Base level weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource.\nH2: Edit Custom Filter\nP: Pseudo-random number generator algorithms are predictable because their registers have a finite number of possible states, which eventually lead to repeating patterns. As a result, pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) can compromise their randomness or expose their internal state to various attacks, such as reverse engineering or tampering. It is highly recommended to use hardware-based true random number generators (TRNGs) to ensure the security of encryption schemes. TRNGs generate unpredictable, unbiased, and independent random numbers because they employ physical phenomena, e.g., electrical noise, as sources to generate random numbers.\nTABLE: NatureTypeIDNameChildOfClass - a weakness that is described in a very abstract fashion, typically independent of any specific language or technology.

While an LFSR will provide a pseudo-random number, its entropy (measure of randomness) is insufficient for a cryptographic algorithm.\nP: Example 2\nP: The example code is taken from the PRNG inside the buggy OpenPiton SoC of HACK@DAC'21 [REF-1370]. The SoC implements a pseudo-random number generator using a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR).\nP: \nP: An example of LFSR with the polynomial function P(x) = x6+x4+x3+1 is shown in the figure.\nP: A LFSR's input bit is determined by the output of a linear function of two or more of its previous states. Therefore, given a long cycle, a LFSR-based PRNG will enter a repeating cycle, which is predictable.\nTABLE: ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2021-3692PHP framework uses mt_rand() function (Marsenne Twister) when generating tokens\nTR: ReferenceDescription\nTR: CVE-2021-3692PHP framework uses mt_rand() function (Marsenne Twister) when generating tokens\nTD: CVE-2021-3692\nTD: PHP framework uses mt_rand() function (Marsenne Twister) when generating tokens\nTABLE: Phase:  Architecture and DesignA true random number generator should be specified for cryptographic algorithms.Phase:  ImplementationA true random number generator should be implemented for cryptographic algorithms.\nTR: Phase:  Architecture and DesignA true random number generator should be specified for cryptographic algorithms.\nTD: Phase:  Architecture and DesignA true random number generator should be specified for cryptographic algorithms.\nP: Phase:  Architecture and Design\nTR: Phase:  ImplementationA true random number generator should be implemented for cryptographic algorithms.\nTD: Phase:  ImplementationA true random number generator should be implemented for cryptographic algorithms.\nP: Phase:  Implementation\nTABLE: NatureTypeIDNameMemberOfCategory - a CWE entry that contains a set of other entries that share a common characteristic.1414Comprehensive Categorization: Randomness\nTR: NatureTypeIDName\nTR: MemberOfCategory - a CWE entry that contains a set of other entries that share a common characteristic.1414Comprehensive Categorization: Randomness\nTD: MemberOf\nTD: Category - a CWE entry that contains a set of other entries that share a common characteristic.\nTD: 1414\nTD: Comprehensive Categorization: Randomness\nTABLE: Usage:ALLOWED(this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)Reason:Acceptable-UseRationale:This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.Comments:Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
