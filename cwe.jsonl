Private personal information may include a password, phone number, geographic location, personal messages, credit card number, etc. Private information is important to consider whether the person is a user of the product, or part of a data set that is processed by the product. An exposure of private information does not necessarily prevent the product from working properly, and in fact the exposure might be intended by the developer, e.g. as part of data sharing with other organizations. However, the exposure of personal private information can still be undesirable or explicitly prohibited by law or regulation.\\n\\nSome types of private information include:\\n\\nSome of this information may be characterized as PII (Personally Identifiable Information), Protected Health Information (PHI), etc. Categories of private information may overlap or vary based on the intended usage or the policies and practices of a particular industry.\\n\\nSometimes data that is not labeled as private can have a privacy implication in a different context. For example, student identification numbers are usually not considered private because there is no explicit and publicly-available mapping to an individual student's personal information. However, if a school generates identification numbers based on student social security numbers, then the identification numbers should be considered private.\",\n    \"Alternate Terms\": \"Privacy violation\\n\\nPrivacy leak\\n\\nPrivacy leakage\",\n    \"Relationships\": \"Relevant to the view \\\"Research Concepts\\\" (CWE-1000)NatureTypeIDNameChildOf200Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized ActorRelevant to the view \\\"Software Development\\\" (CWE-699)NatureTypeIDNameMemberOf199Information Management ErrorsRelevant to the view \\\"Architectural Concepts\\\" (CWE-1008)NatureTypeIDNameMemberOf1011Authorize Actors\",\n    \"Modes of Introduction\": \"PhaseNote\\n\\nArchitecture and DesignOMISSION: This weakness is caused by missing a security tactic during the architecture and design phase.\\n\\nImplementation\\n\\nOperation\",\n    \"Applicable Platforms\": \"Languages\\n\\nClass: Not Language-Specific(Undetermined Prevalence)\\n\\nTechnologies\\n\\nClass: Mobile(Undetermined Prevalence)\",\n    \"Common Consequences\": \"ScopeImpactLikelihood\\n\\nConfidentialityTechnical Impact:Read Application Data\",\n    \"Likelihood of Exploit\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Demonstrative Examples\": \"Example 1The following code contains a logging statement that tracks the contents of records added to a database by storing them in a log file.

Although many developers trust the filesystem as a safe storage location for data, it should not be trusted implicitly, particularly when privacy is a concern.Example 2This code uses location to determine the user's current US State location.First the application must declare that it requires the ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permission in the application's manifest.xml:(bad code)Example Language:XML<uses-permission android:name=\\\"android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION\\\"/>During execution, a call to getLastLocation() will return a location based on the application's location permissions.

Security and privacy concerns often seem to compete with each other. From a security perspective, all important operations should be recorded so that any anomalous activity can later be identified. However, when private data is involved, this practice can in fact create risk. Although there are many ways in which private data can be handled unsafely, a common risk stems from misplaced trust. Programmers often trust the operating environment in which a program runs, and therefore believe that it is acceptable store private information on the file system, in the registry, or in other locally-controlled resources.

API functions or other abstractions are often used to perform this release, such as free() or delete() within C/C++, or file-handle close() operations that are used in many languages.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the implementation or design of such APIs might expect the developer to be responsible for ensuring that such APIs are only called once per release of the resource. If the developer attempts to release the same resource/handle more than once, then the API's expectations are not met, resulting in undefined and/or insecure behavior. This could lead to consequences such as memory corruption, data corruption, execution path corruption, or other consequences.\\n\\nNote that while the implementation for most (if not all) resource reservation allocations involve a unique identifier/pointer/symbolic reference, then if this identifier is reused, checking the identifier for resource closure may result in a false state of openness and closing of the wrong resource.

In some cases, the C library fclose() function will catch the error and return an error code. In other implementations, a double-free (CWE-415) occurs, causing the program to fault. Note that the examples presented here are simplistic, and double fclose() calls will frequently be spread around a program, making them more difficult to find during code reviews.(bad code)Example Language:Cchar b[2000];FILE *f = fopen(\\\"dbl_cls.c\\\", \\\"r\\\");if (f){b[0] = 0;fread(b, 1, sizeof(b) - 1, f);printf(\\\"%s\\\\n'\\\", b);int r1 = fclose(f);printf(\\\"\\\\n-----------------\\\\n1 close done '%d'\\\\n\\\", r1);int r2 = fclose(f);\\t// Double closeprintf(\\\"2 close done '%d'\\\\n\\\", r2);}There are multiple possible fixes.

Note that this flag is explicit. The variable \\\"f\\\" could also have been used as it will be either NULL if the file is not able to be opened or a valid pointer if the file was successfully opened. If \\\"f\\\" is replacing \\\"f_flg\\\" then \\\"f\\\" would need to be set to NULL after the first fclose() call so the second fclose call would never be executed.(good code)Example Language:Cchar b[2000];int f_flg = 0;FILE *f = fopen(\\\"dbl_cls.c\\\", \\\"r\\\");if (f){f_flg = 1;b[0] = 0;fread(b, 1, sizeof(b) - 1, f);printf(\\\"%s\\\\n'\\\", b);if (f_flg){int r1 = fclose(f);f_flg = 0;printf(\\\"\\\\n-----------------\\\\n1 close done '%d'\\\\n\\\", r1);}if (f_flg){int r2 = fclose(f);\\t// Double closef_flg = 0;printf(\\\"2 close done '%d'\\\\n\\\", r2);}}Example 2The following code shows a simple example of a double free vulnerability.(bad code)Example Language:Cchar* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);...if (abrt) {free(ptr);}...free(ptr);Double free vulnerabilities have two common (and sometimes overlapping) causes:Error conditions and other exceptional circumstancesConfusion over which part of the program is responsible for freeing the memoryAlthough some double free vulnerabilities are not much more complicated than this example, most are spread out across hundreds of lines of code or even different files.

However, this pointer is later incorrectly used in the logError function.Example 2The following code shows a simple example of a double free error:(bad code)Example Language:Cchar* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);...if (abrt) {free(ptr);}...free(ptr);Double free vulnerabilities have two common (and sometimes overlapping) causes:Error conditions and other exceptional circumstancesConfusion over which part of the program is responsible for freeing the memoryAlthough some double free vulnerabilities are not much more complicated than the previous example, most are spread out across hundreds of lines of code or even different files. Programmers seem particularly susceptible to freeing global variables more than once.Example 3In the following C/C++ example the method processMessage is used to process a message received in the input array of char arrays. The input message array contains two char arrays: the first is the length of the message and the second is the body of the message. The length of the message is retrieved and used to allocate enough memory for a local char array, messageBody, to be created for the message body. The messageBody is processed in the method processMessageBody that will return an error if an error occurs while processing. If an error occurs then the return result variable is set to indicate an error and the messageBody char array memory is released using the method free and an error message is sent to the logError method.(bad code)Example Language:C#define FAIL 0#define SUCCESS 1#define ERROR -1#define MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE 32int processMessage(char **message){int result = SUCCESS;int length = getMessageLength(message[0]);char *messageBody;if ((length > 0) && (length < MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE)) {messageBody = (char*)malloc(length*sizeof(char));messageBody = &message[1][0];int success = processMessageBody(messageBody);if (success == ERROR) {result = ERROR;free(messageBody);}}else {printf(\\\"Unable to process message; invalid message length\\\");result = FAIL;}if (result == ERROR) {logError(\\\"Error processing message\\\", messageBody);}return result;}However, the call to the method logError includes the messageBody after the memory for messageBody has been released using the free method. This can cause unexpected results and may lead to system crashes. A variable should never be used after its memory resources have been released.(good code)Example Language:C...messageBody = (char*)malloc(length*sizeof(char));messageBody = &message[1][0];int success = processMessageBody(messageBody);if (success == ERROR) {result = ERROR;logError(\\\"Error processing message\\\", messageBody);free(messageBody);}...\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2009-3547Chain: race condition (CWE-362) might allow resource to be released before operating on it, leading to NULL dereference (CWE-476)\",\n    \"References\": \"[REF-962] Object Management Group (OMG). \\\"Automated Source Code Security Measure (ASCSM)\\\".

Some hash functions perform salting automatically. These functions can significantly increase the overhead for a brute force attack compared to intentionally-fast functions such as MD5. For example, rainbow table attacks can become infeasible due to the high computing overhead. Finally, since computing power gets faster and cheaper over time, the technique can be reconfigured to increase the workload without forcing an entire replacement of the algorithm in use.Some hash functions that have one or more of these desired properties include bcrypt [REF-291], scrypt [REF-292], and PBKDF2 [REF-293]. While there is active debate about which of these is the most effective, they are all stronger than using salts with hash functions with very little computing overhead.Note that using these functions can have an impact on performance, so they require special consideration to avoid denial-of-service attacks. However, their configurability provides finer control over how much CPU and memory is used, so it could be adjusted to suit the environment's needs.Effectiveness: High\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignIf a technique that requires extra computational effort can not be implemented, then for each password that is processed, generate a new random salt using a strong random number generator with unpredictable seeds. Add the salt to the plaintext password before hashing it. When storing the hash, also store the salt. Do not use the same salt for every password.Effectiveness: LimitedNote:Be aware that salts will not reduce the workload of a targeted attack against an individual hash (such as the password for a critical person), and in general they are less effective than other hashing techniques such as increasing the computation time or memory overhead. Without a built-in workload, modern attacks can compute large numbers of hashes, or even exhaust the entire space of all possible passwords, within a very short amount of time, using massively-parallel computing and GPU, ASIC, or FPGA hardware.\\n\\nPhases:  Implementation; Architecture and DesignWhen using industry-approved techniques, use them correctly.

Use an \\\"accept known good\\\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \\\"boat\\\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \\\"red\\\" or \\\"blue.\\\"Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.To reduce the likelihood of introducing an out-of-bounds read, ensure that you validate and ensure correct calculations for any length argument, buffer size calculation, or offset.

This exposes the user's login information if their computer is compromised by an attacker. Even if the user's machine is not compromised, this weakness combined with cross-site scripting (CWE-79) could allow an attacker to remotely copy the cookie.Also note this example code also exhibits Plaintext Storage in a Cookie (CWE-315).Example 3The following code attempts to establish a connection, read in a password, then store it to a buffer.(bad code)Example Language:Cserver.sin_family = AF_INET; hp = gethostbyname(argv[1]);if (hp==NULL) error(\\\"Unknown host\\\");memcpy( (char *)&server.sin_addr,(char *)hp->h_addr,hp->h_length);if (argc < 3) port = 80;else port = (unsigned short)atoi(argv[3]);server.sin_port = htons(port);if (connect(sock, (struct sockaddr *)&server, sizeof server) < 0) error(\\\"Connecting\\\");...while ((n=read(sock,buffer,BUFSIZE-1))!=-1) {write(dfd,password_buffer,n);...While successful, the program does not encrypt the data before writing it to a buffer, possibly exposing it to unauthorized actors.Example 4The following examples show a portion of properties and configuration files for Java and ASP.NET applications. The files include username and password information but they are stored in cleartext.This Java example shows a properties file with a cleartext username / password pair.(bad code)Example Language:Java# Java Web App ResourceBundle properties file...webapp.ldap.username=secretUsernamewebapp.ldap.password=secretPassword...The following example shows a portion of a configuration file for an ASP.Net application. This configuration file includes username and password information for a connection to a database but the pair is stored in cleartext.(bad code)Example Language:ASP.NET...<connectionStrings><add name=\\\"ud_DEV\\\" connectionString=\\\"connectDB=uDB; uid=db2admin; pwd=password; dbalias=uDB;\\\" providerName=\\\"System.Data.Odbc\\\" /></connectionStrings>...Username and password information should not be included in a configuration file or a properties file in cleartext as this will allow anyone who can read the file access to the resource. If possible, encrypt this information.Example 5In 2022, the OT:ICEFALL study examined products by 10 different Operational Technology (OT) vendors. The researchers reported 56 vulnerabilities and said that the products were \\\"insecure by design\\\" [REF-1283]. If exploited, these vulnerabilities often allowed adversaries to change how the products operated, ranging from denial of service to changing the code that the products executed. Since these products were often used in industries such as power, electrical, water, and others, there could even be safety implications.At least one OT product stored a password in plaintext.Example 6In 2021, a web site operated by PeopleGIS stored data of US municipalities in Amazon Web Service (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3) buckets.(bad code)Example Language:OtherA security researcher found 86 S3 buckets that could be accessed without authentication (CWE-306) and stored data unencrypted (CWE-312). These buckets exposed over 1000 GB of data and 1.6 million files including physical addresses, phone numbers, tax documents, pictures of driver's license IDs, etc. [REF-1296] [REF-1295]While it was not publicly disclosed how the data was protected after discovery, multiple options could have been considered.(good code)Example Language:OtherThe sensitive information could have been protected by ensuring that the buckets did not have public read access, e.g., by enabling the s3-account-level-public-access-blocks-periodic rule to Block Public Access. In addition, the data could have been encrypted at rest using the appropriate S3 settings, e.g., by enabling server-side encryption using the s3-bucket-server-side-encryption-enabled setting. Other settings are available to further prevent bucket data from being leaked. [REF-1297]Example 7Consider the following PowerShell command examples for encryption scopes of Azure storage objects. In the first example, an encryption scope is set for the storage account.(bad code)Example Language:ShellNew-AzStorageEncryptionScope -ResourceGroupName \\\"MyResourceGroup\\\" -AccountName \\\"MyStorageAccount\\\" -EncryptionScopeName testscope -StorageEncryptionThe result (edited and formatted for readability) might be:(bad code)Example Language:OtherResourceGroupName: MyResourceGroup, StorageAccountName: MyStorageAccountNameStateSourceRequireInfrastructureEncryptiontestscopeEnabledMicrosoft.StorageHowever, the empty string under RequireInfrastructureEncryption indicates this service was not enabled at the time of creation, because the -RequireInfrastructureEncryption argument was not specified in the command.Including the -RequireInfrastructureEncryption argument addresses the issue:(good code)Example Language:ShellNew-AzStorageEncryptionScope -ResourceGroupName \\\"MyResourceGroup\\\" -AccountName \\\"MyStorageAccount\\\" -EncryptionScopeName testscope -StorageEncryption -RequireInfrastructureEncryptionThis produces the report:(result)Example Language:OtherResourceGroupName: MyResourceGroup, StorageAccountName: MyStorageAccountNameStateSourceRequireInfrastructureEncryptiontestscopeEnabledMicrosoft.KeyvaultTrueIn a scenario where both software and hardware layer encryption is required (\\\"double encryption\\\"), Azure's infrastructure encryption setting can be enabled via the CLI or Portal. An important note is that infrastructure hardware encryption cannot be enabled or disabled after a blob is created.

However, numHeaders is defined as a signed int, so it could be negative. If the incoming packet specifies a value such as -3, then the malloc calculation will generate a negative number (say, -300 if each header can be a maximum of 100 bytes). When this result is provided to malloc(), it is first converted to a size_t type. This conversion then produces a large value such as 4294966996, which may cause malloc() to fail or to allocate an extremely large amount of memory (CWE-195). With the appropriate negative numbers, an attacker could trick malloc() into using a very small positive number, which then allocates a buffer that is much smaller than expected, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.Example 2The following code reads a maximum size and performs a sanity check on that size. It then performs a strncpy, assuming it will not exceed the boundaries of the array. While the use of \\\"short s\\\" is forced in this particular example, short int's are frequently used within real-world code, such as code that processes structured data.(bad code)Example Language:Cint GetUntrustedInt () {return(0x0000FFFF);}void main (int argc, char **argv) {char path[256];char *input;int i;short s;unsigned int sz;i = GetUntrustedInt();s = i;/* s is -1 so it passes the safety check -CWE-697*/if (s > 256) {DiePainfully(\\\"go away!\\\\n\\\");}/* s is sign-extended and saved in sz */sz = s;/* output: i=65535, s=-1, sz=4294967295 - your mileage may vary */printf(\\\"i=%d, s=%d, sz=%u\\\\n\\\", i, s, sz);input = GetUserInput(\\\"Enter pathname:\\\");/* strncpy interprets s as unsigned int, so it's treated as MAX_INT(CWE-195), enabling buffer overflow (CWE-119) */strncpy(path, input, s);path[255] = '\\\\0'; /* don't wantCWE-170*/printf(\\\"Path is: %s\\\\n\\\", path);}This code first exhibits an example ofCWE-839, allowing \\\"s\\\" to be a negative number. When the negative short \\\"s\\\" is converted to an unsigned integer, it becomes an extremely large positive integer. When this converted integer is used by strncpy() it will lead to a buffer overflow (CWE-119).Example 3In the following code, the method retrieves a value from an array at a specific array index location that is given as an input parameter to the method(bad code)Example Language:Cint getValueFromArray(int *array, int len, int index) {int value;// check that the array index is less than the maximum// length of the arrayif (index < len) {// get the value at the specified index of the arrayvalue = array[index];}// if array index is invalid then output error message// and return value indicating errorelse {printf(\\\"Value is: %d\\\\n\\\", array[index]);value = -1;}return value;}However, this method only verifies that the given array index is less than the maximum length of the array but does not check for the minimum value (CWE-839). This will allow a negative value to be accepted as the input array index, which will result in a out of bounds read (CWE-125) and may allow access to sensitive memory. The input array index should be checked to verify that is within the maximum and minimum range required for the array (CWE-129). In this example the if statement should be modified to include a minimum range check, as shown below.(good code)Example Language:C...// check that the array index is within the correct// range of values for the arrayif (index >= 0 && index < len) {...Example 4The following code shows a simple BankAccount class with deposit and withdraw methods.(bad code)Example Language:Javapublic class BankAccount {public final int MAXIMUM_WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT = 350;// variable for bank account balanceprivate double accountBalance;// constructor for BankAccountpublic BankAccount() {accountBalance = 0;}// method to deposit amount into BankAccountpublic void deposit(double depositAmount) {...}// method to withdraw amount from BankAccountpublic void withdraw(double withdrawAmount) {if (withdrawAmount < MAXIMUM_WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT) {double newBalance = accountBalance - withdrawAmount;accountBalance = newBalance;}else {System.err.println(\\\"Withdrawal amount exceeds the maximum limit allowed, please try again...\\\");...}}// other methods for accessing the BankAccount object...}The withdraw method includes a check to ensure that the withdrawal amount does not exceed the maximum limit allowed, however the method does not check to ensure that the withdrawal amount is greater than a minimum value (CWE-129). Performing a range check on a value that does not include a minimum check can have significant security implications, in this case not including a minimum range check can allow a negative value to be used which would cause the financial application using this class to deposit money into the user account rather than withdrawing. In this example the if statement should the modified to include a minimum range check, as shown below.(good code)Example Language:Javapublic class BankAccount {public final int MINIMUM_WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT = 0;public final int MAXIMUM_WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT = 350;...// method to withdraw amount from BankAccountpublic void withdraw(double withdrawAmount) {if (withdrawAmount < MAXIMUM_WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT &&withdrawAmount > MINIMUM_WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT) {...Note that this example does not protect against concurrent access to the BankAccount balance variable, seeCWE-413andCWE-362.While it is out of scope for this example, note that the use of doubles or floats in financial calculations may be subject to certain kinds of attacks where attackers use rounding errors to steal money.\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2010-1866Chain: integer overflow (CWE-190) causes a negative signed value, which later bypasses a maximum-only check (CWE-839), leading to heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).CVE-2009-1099Chain: 16-bit counter can be interpreted as a negative value, compared to a 32-bit maximum value, leading to buffer under-write.CVE-2011-0521Chain: kernel's lack of a check for a negative value leads to memory corruption.CVE-2010-3704Chain: parser uses atoi() but does not check for a negative value, which can happen on some platforms, leading to buffer under-write.CVE-2010-2530Chain: Negative value stored in an int bypasses a size check and causes allocation of large amounts of memory.CVE-2009-3080Chain: negative offset value to IOCTL bypasses check for maximum index, then used as an array index for buffer under-read.CVE-2008-6393chain: file transfer client performs signed comparison, leading to integer overflow and heap-based buffer overflow.CVE-2008-4558chain: negative ID in media player bypasses check for maximum index, then used as an array index for buffer under-read.\",\n    \"References\": \"[REF-62] Mark Dowd, John McDonald\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand Justin Schuh. \\\"The Art of Software Security Assessment\\\".

This single string worked against many different programs. The SQL injection was then used to modify the web sites to serve malicious code.Example 2The following code dynamically constructs and executes a SQL query that searches for items matching a specified name. The query restricts the items displayed to those where owner matches the user name of the currently-authenticated user.(bad code)Example Language:C#...string userName = ctx.getAuthenticatedUserName();string query = \\\"SELECT * FROM items WHERE owner = '\\\" + userName + \\\"' AND itemname = '\\\" + ItemName.Text + \\\"'\\\";sda = new SqlDataAdapter(query, conn);DataTable dt = new DataTable();sda.Fill(dt);...The query that this code intends to execute follows:(informative)SELECT * FROM items WHERE owner = <userName> AND itemname = <itemName>;However, because the query is constructed dynamically by concatenating a constant base query string and a user input string, the query only behaves correctly if itemName does not contain a single-quote character. If an attacker with the user name wiley enters the string:(attack code)name' OR 'a'='afor itemName, then the query becomes the following:(attack code)SELECT * FROM items WHERE owner = 'wiley' AND itemname = 'name' OR 'a'='a';The addition of the:(attack code)OR 'a'='acondition causes the WHERE clause to always evaluate to true, so the query becomes logically equivalent to the much simpler query:(attack code)SELECT * FROM items;This simplification of the query allows the attacker to bypass the requirement that the query only return items owned by the authenticated user; the query now returns all entries stored in the items table, regardless of their specified owner.Example 3This example examines the effects of a different malicious value passed to the query constructed and executed in the previous example.If an attacker with the user name wiley enters the string:(attack code)name'; DELETE FROM items; --for itemName, then the query becomes the following two queries:(attack code)Example Language:SQLSELECT * FROM items WHERE owner = 'wiley' AND itemname = 'name';DELETE FROM items;--'Many database servers, including Microsoft(R) SQL Server 2000, allow multiple SQL statements separated by semicolons to be executed at once. While this attack string results in an error on Oracle and other database servers that do not allow the batch-execution of statements separated by semicolons, on databases that do allow batch execution, this type of attack allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands against the database.Notice the trailing pair of hyphens (--), which specifies to most database servers that the remainder of the statement is to be treated as a comment and not executed. In this case the comment character serves to remove the trailing single-quote left over from the modified query. On a database where comments are not allowed to be used in this way, the general attack could still be made effective using a trick similar to the one shown in the previous example.If an attacker enters the string(attack code)name'; DELETE FROM items; SELECT * FROM items WHERE 'a'='aThen the following three valid statements will be created:(attack code)SELECT * FROM items WHERE owner = 'wiley' AND itemname = 'name';DELETE FROM items;SELECT * FROM items WHERE 'a'='a';One traditional approach to preventing SQL injection attacks is to handle them as an input validation problem and either accept only characters from an allowlist of safe values or identify and escape a denylist of potentially malicious values. Allowlists can be a very effective means of enforcing strict input validation rules, but parameterized SQL statements require less maintenance and can offer more guarantees with respect to security. As is almost always the case, denylisting is riddled with loopholes that make it ineffective at preventing SQL injection attacks. For example, attackers can:Target fields that are not quotedFind ways to bypass the need for certain escaped meta-charactersUse stored procedures to hide the injected meta-characters.Manually escaping characters in input to SQL queries can help, but it will not make your application secure from SQL injection attacks.Another solution commonly proposed for dealing with SQL injection attacks is to use stored procedures. Although stored procedures prevent some types of SQL injection attacks, they do not protect against many others. For example, the following PL/SQL procedure is vulnerable to the same SQL injection attack shown in the first example.(bad code)procedure get_item ( itm_cv IN OUT ItmCurTyp, usr in varchar2, itm in varchar2)is open itm_cv for' SELECT * FROM items WHERE ' || 'owner = '|| usr || ' AND itemname = ' || itm || ';end get_item;Stored procedures typically help prevent SQL injection attacks by limiting the types of statements that can be passed to their parameters. However, there are many ways around the limitations and many interesting statements that can still be passed to stored procedures. Again, stored procedures can prevent some exploits, but they will not make your application secure against SQL injection attacks.Example 4MS SQL has a built in function that enables shell command execution. An SQL injection in such a context could be disastrous. For example, a query of the form:(bad code)SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY='$user_input' ORDER BY PRICEWhere $user_input is taken from an untrusted source.If the user provides the string:(attack code)'; exec master..xp_cmdshell 'dir' --The query will take the following form:(attack code)SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY=''; exec master..xp_cmdshell 'dir' --' ORDER BY PRICENow, this query can be broken down into:a first SQL query: SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY='';a second SQL query, which executes the dir command in the shell: exec master..xp_cmdshell 'dir'an MS SQL comment: --' ORDER BY PRICEAs can be seen, the malicious input changes the semantics of the query into a query, a shell command execution and a comment.Example 5This code intends to print a message summary given the message ID.(bad code)Example Language:PHP$id = $_COOKIE[\\\"mid\\\"];mysql_query(\\\"SELECT MessageID, Subject FROM messages WHERE MessageID = '$id'\\\");The programmer may have skipped any input validation on $id under the assumption that attackers cannot modify the cookie. However, this is easy to do with custom client code or even in the web browser.While $id is wrapped in single quotes in the call to mysql_query(), an attacker could simply change the incoming mid cookie to:(attack code)1432' or '1' = '1This would produce the resulting query:(result)SELECT MessageID, Subject FROM messages WHERE MessageID = '1432' or '1' = '1'Not only will this retrieve message number 1432, it will retrieve all other messages.In this case, the programmer could apply a simple modification to the code to eliminate the SQL injection:(good code)Example Language:PHP$id = intval($_COOKIE[\\\"mid\\\"]);mysql_query(\\\"SELECT MessageID, Subject FROM messages WHERE MessageID = '$id'\\\");However, if this code is intended to support multiple users with different message boxes, the code might also need an access control check (CWE-285) to ensure that the application user has the permission to see that message.Example 6This example attempts to take a last name provided by a user and enter it into a database.(bad code)Example Language:Perl$userKey = getUserID();$name = getUserInput();# ensure only letters, hyphens and apostrophe are allowed$name = allowList($name, \\\"^a-zA-z'-$\\\");$query = \\\"INSERT INTO last_names VALUES('$userKey', '$name')\\\";While the programmer applies an allowlist to the user input, it has shortcomings. First of all, the user is still allowed to provide hyphens, which are used as comment structures in SQL. If a user specifies \\\"--\\\" then the remainder of the statement will be treated as a comment, which may bypass security logic. Furthermore, the allowlist permits the apostrophe, which is also a data / command separator in SQL. If a user supplies a name with an apostrophe, they may be able to alter the structure of the whole statement and even change control flow of the program, possibly accessing or modifying confidential information. In this situation, both the hyphen and apostrophe are legitimate characters for a last name and permitting them is required. Instead, a programmer may want to use a prepared statement or apply an encoding routine to the input to prevent any data / directive misinterpretations.\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2023-32530SQL injection in security product dashboard using crafted certificate fieldsCVE-2021-42258SQL injection in time and billing software, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.CVE-2021-27101SQL injection in file-transfer system via a crafted Host header, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.CVE-2020-12271SQL injection in firewall product's admin interface or user portal, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.CVE-2019-3792An automation system written in Go contains an API that is vulnerable to SQL injection allowing the attacker to read privileged data.CVE-2004-0366chain: SQL injection in library intended for database authentication allows SQL injection and authentication bypass.CVE-2008-2790SQL injection through an ID that was supposed to be numeric.CVE-2008-2223SQL injection through an ID that was supposed to be numeric.CVE-2007-6602SQL injection via user name.CVE-2008-5817SQL injection via user name or password fields.CVE-2003-0377SQL injection in security product, using a crafted group name.CVE-2008-2380SQL injection in authentication library.CVE-2017-11508SQL injection in vulnerability management and reporting tool, using a crafted password.\",\n    \"References\": \"[REF-44] Michael Howard, David LeBlanc\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand John Viega. \\\"24 Deadly Sins of Software Security\\\". \\\"Sin 1: SQL Injection.\\\" Page 3.

does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.For example, consider using persistence layers such as Hibernate or Enterprise Java Beans, which can provide significant protection against SQL injection if used properly.\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignStrategy:  ParameterizationIf available, use structured mechanisms that automatically enforce the separation between data and code. These mechanisms may be able to provide the relevant quoting, encoding, and validation automatically, instead of relying on the developer to provide this capability at every point where output is generated.Process SQL queries using prepared statements, parameterized queries, or stored procedures. These features should accept parameters or variables and support strong typing. Do not dynamically construct and execute query strings within these features using \\\"exec\\\" or similar functionality, since this may re-introduce the possibility of SQL injection. [REF-867]\\n\\nPhases:  Architecture and Design; OperationStrategy:  Environment HardeningRun your code using the lowest privileges that are required to accomplish the necessary tasks [REF-76]. If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a single task. That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.Specifically, follow the principle of least privilege when creating user accounts to a SQL database. The database users should only have the minimum privileges necessary to use their account. If the requirements of the system indicate that a user can read and modify their own data, then limit their privileges so they cannot read/write others' data. Use the strictest permissions possible on all database objects, such as execute-only for stored procedures.\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignFor any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoidCWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Output EncodingWhile it is risky to use dynamically-generated query strings, code, or commands that mix control and data together, sometimes it may be unavoidable. Properly quote arguments and escape any special characters within those arguments. The most conservative approach is to escape or filter all characters that do not pass an extremely strict allowlist (such as everything that is not alphanumeric or white space). If some special characters are still needed, such as white space, wrap each argument in quotes after the escaping/filtering step. Be careful of argument injection (CWE-88).Instead of building a new implementation, such features may be available in the database or programming language. For example, the Oracle DBMS_ASSERT package can check or enforce that parameters have certain properties that make them less vulnerable to SQL injection. For MySQL, the mysql_real_escape_string() API function is available in both C and PHP.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Input ValidationAssume all input is malicious. Use an \\\"accept known good\\\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \\\"boat\\\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \\\"red\\\" or \\\"blue.\\\"Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.When constructing SQL query strings, use stringent allowlists that limit the character set based on the expected value of the parameter in the request. This will indirectly limit the scope of an attack, but this technique is less important than proper output encoding and escaping.Note that proper output encoding, escaping, and quoting is the most effective solution for preventing SQL injection, although input validation may provide some defense-in-depth. This is because it effectively limits what will appear in output. Input validation will not always prevent SQL injection, especially if you are required to support free-form text fields that could contain arbitrary characters. For example, the name \\\"O'Reilly\\\" would likely pass the validation step, since it is a common last name in the English language. However, it cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the \\\"'\\\" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise handled. In this case, stripping the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.When feasible, it may be safest to disallow meta-characters entirely, instead of escaping them. This will provide some defense in depth. After the data is entered into the database, later processes may neglect to escape meta-characters before use, and you may not have control over those processes.\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignStrategy:  Enforcement by ConversionWhen the set of acceptable objects, such as filenames or URLs, is limited or known, create a mapping from a set of fixed input values (such as numeric IDs) to the actual filenames or URLs, and reject all other inputs.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationEnsure that error messages only contain minimal details that are useful to the intended audience and no one else. The messages need to strike the balance between being too cryptic (which can confuse users) or being too detailed (which may reveal more than intended). The messages should not reveal the methods that were used to determine the error. Attackers can use detailed information to refine or optimize their original attack, thereby increasing their chances of success.If errors must be captured in some detail, record them in log messages, but consider what could occur if the log messages can be viewed by attackers. Highly sensitive information such as passwords should never be saved to log files.Avoid inconsistent messaging that might accidentally tip off an attacker about internal state, such as whether a user account exists or not.In the context of SQL Injection, error messages revealing the structure of a SQL query can help attackers tailor successful attack strings.\\n\\nPhase:  OperationStrategy:  FirewallUse an application firewall that can detect attacks against this weakness. It can be beneficial in cases in which the code cannot be fixed (because it is controlled by a third party), as an emergency prevention measure while more comprehensive software assurance measures are applied, or to provide defense in depth.Effectiveness: ModerateNote:An application firewall might not cover all possible input vectors. In addition, attack techniques might be available to bypass the protection mechanism, such as using malformed inputs that can still be processed by the component that receives those inputs. Depending on functionality, an application firewall might inadvertently reject or modify legitimate requests. Finally, some manual effort may be required for customization.\\n\\nPhases:  Operation; ImplementationStrategy:  Environment HardeningWhen using PHP, configure the application so that it does not use register_globals. During implementation, develop the application so that it does not rely on this feature, but be wary of implementing a register_globals emulation that is subject to weaknesses such asCWE-95,CWE-621, and similar issues.\",\n    \"Weakness Ordinalities\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Detection Methods\": \"Automated Static AnalysisThis weakness can often be detected using automated static analysis tools. Many modern tools use data flow analysis or constraint-based techniques to minimize the number of false positives.Automated static analysis might not be able to recognize when proper input validation is being performed, leading to false positives - i.e., warnings that do not have any security consequences or do not require any code changes.Automated static analysis might not be able to detect the usage of custom API functions or third-party libraries that indirectly invoke SQL commands, leading to false negatives - especially if the API/library code is not available for analysis.Note:This is not a perfect solution, since 100% accuracy and coverage are not feasible.Automated Dynamic AnalysisThis weakness can be detected using dynamic tools and techniques that interact with the software using large test suites with many diverse inputs, such as fuzz testing (fuzzing), robustness testing, and fault injection. The software's operation may slow down, but it should not become unstable, crash, or generate incorrect results.Effectiveness: ModerateManual AnalysisManual analysis can be useful for finding this weakness, but it might not achieve desired code coverage within limited time constraints. This becomes difficult for weaknesses that must be considered for all inputs, since the attack surface can be too large.Automated Static Analysis - Binary or BytecodeAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Highly cost effective:Bytecode Weakness Analysis - including disassembler + source code weakness analysisBinary Weakness Analysis - including disassembler + source code weakness analysisEffectiveness: HighDynamic Analysis with Automated Results InterpretationAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Highly cost effective:Database ScannersCost effective for partial coverage:Web Application ScannerWeb Services ScannerEffectiveness: HighDynamic Analysis with Manual Results InterpretationAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Cost effective for partial coverage:Fuzz TesterFramework-based FuzzerEffectiveness: SOAR PartialManual Static Analysis - Source CodeAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Highly cost effective:Manual Source Code Review (not inspections)Cost effective for partial coverage:Focused Manual Spotcheck - Focused manual analysis of sourceEffectiveness: HighAutomated Static Analysis - Source CodeAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Highly cost effective:Source code Weakness AnalyzerContext-configured Source Code Weakness AnalyzerEffectiveness: HighArchitecture or Design ReviewAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Highly cost effective:Formal Methods / Correct-By-ConstructionCost effective for partial coverage:Inspection (IEEE 1028 standard) (can apply to requirements, design, source code, etc.)Effectiveness: High\",\n    \"Functional Areas\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Affected Resources\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Memberships\": \"NatureTypeIDNameMemberOf635Weaknesses Originally Used by NVD from 2008 to 2016MemberOf713OWASP Top Ten 2007 Category A2 - Injection FlawsMemberOf722OWASP Top Ten 2004 Category A1 - Unvalidated InputMemberOf727OWASP Top Ten 2004 Category A6 - Injection FlawsMemberOf7512009 Top 25 - Insecure Interaction Between ComponentsMemberOf8012010 Top 25 - Insecure Interaction Between ComponentsMemberOf810OWASP Top Ten 2010 Category A1 - InjectionMemberOf8642011 Top 25 - Insecure Interaction Between ComponentsMemberOf884CWE Cross-sectionMemberOf929OWASP Top Ten 2013 Category A1 - InjectionMemberOf990SFP Secondary Cluster: Tainted Input to CommandMemberOf10057PK - Input Validation and RepresentationMemberOf1027OWASP Top Ten 2017 Category A1 - InjectionMemberOf1131CISQ Quality Measures (2016) - SecurityMemberOf1200Weaknesses in the 2019 CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software ErrorsMemberOf1308CISQ Quality Measures - SecurityMemberOf1337Weaknesses in the 2021 CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software WeaknessesMemberOf1340CISQ Data Protection MeasuresMemberOf1347OWASP Top Ten 2021 Category A03:2021 - InjectionMemberOf1350Weaknesses in the 2020 CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software WeaknessesMemberOf1387Weaknesses in the 2022 CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software WeaknessesMemberOf1409Comprehensive Categorization: InjectionMemberOf1425Weaknesses in the 2023 CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses\",\n    \"Vulnerability Mapping Notes\": \"Usage:ALLOWED(this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)Reason:Acceptable-UseRationale:This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.Comments:Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

These race conditions have a variety of root causes and symptoms. Attackers may be able to exploit a signal handler race condition to cause the product state to be corrupted, possibly leading to a denial of service or even code execution.\\n\\nThese issues occur when non-reentrant functions, or state-sensitive actions occur in the signal handler, where they may be called at any time. These behaviors can violate assumptions being made by the \\\"regular\\\" code that is interrupted, or by other signal handlers that may also be invoked. If these functions are called at an inopportune moment - such as while a non-reentrant function is already running - memory corruption could occur that may be exploitable for code execution. Another signal race condition commonly found occurs when free is called within a signal handler, resulting in a double free and therefore a write-what-where condition. Even if a given pointer is set to NULL after it has been freed, a race condition still exists between the time the memory was freed and the pointer was set to NULL. This is especially problematic if the same signal handler has been set for more than one signal -- since it means that the signal handler itself may be reentered.\\n\\nThere are several known behaviors related to signal handlers that have received the label of \\\"signal handler race condition\\\":\\n\\nSignal handler vulnerabilities are often classified based on the absence of a specific protection mechanism, although this style of classification is discouraged in CWE because programmers often have a choice of several different mechanisms for addressing the weakness.

If those signals are sent to the process, the handler creates a log message (specified in the first argument to the program) and exits.(bad code)Example Language:Cchar *logMessage;void handler (int sigNum) {syslog(LOG_NOTICE, \\\"%s\\\\n\\\", logMessage);free(logMessage);/* artificially increase the size of the timing window to make demonstration of this weakness easier. */sleep(10);exit(0);}int main (int argc, char* argv[]) {logMessage = strdup(argv[1]);/* Register signal handlers. */signal(SIGHUP, handler);signal(SIGTERM, handler);/* artificially increase the size of the timing window to make demonstration of this weakness easier. */sleep(10);}The handler function uses global state (globalVar and logMessage), and it can be called by both the SIGHUP and SIGTERM signals. An attack scenario might follow these lines:The program begins execution, initializes logMessage, and registers the signal handlers for SIGHUP and SIGTERM.The program begins its \\\"normal\\\" functionality, which is simplified as sleep(), but could be any functionality that consumes some time.The attacker sends SIGHUP, which invokes handler (call this \\\"SIGHUP-handler\\\").SIGHUP-handler begins to execute, calling syslog().syslog() calls malloc(), which is non-reentrant. malloc() begins to modify metadata to manage the heap.The attacker then sends SIGTERM.SIGHUP-handler is interrupted, but syslog's malloc call is still executing and has not finished modifying its metadata.The SIGTERM handler is invoked.SIGTERM-handler records the log message using syslog(), then frees the logMessage variable.At this point, the state of the heap is uncertain, because malloc is still modifying the metadata for the heap; the metadata might be in an inconsistent state. The SIGTERM-handler call to free() is assuming that the metadata is inconsistent, possibly causing it to write data to the wrong location while managing the heap. The result is memory corruption, which could lead to a crash or even code execution, depending on the circumstances under which the code is running.Note that this is an adaptation of a classic example as originally presented by Michal Zalewski [REF-360]; the original example was shown to be exploitable for code execution.Also note that the strdup(argv[1]) call contains a potential buffer over-read (CWE-126) if the program is called without any arguments, because argc would be 0, and argv[1] would point outside the bounds of the array.Example 2The following code registers a signal handler with multiple signals in order to log when a specific event occurs and to free associated memory before exiting.(bad code)Example Language:C#include <signal.h>#include <syslog.h>#include <string.h>#include <stdlib.h>void *global1, *global2;char *what;void sh (int dummy) {syslog(LOG_NOTICE,\\\"%s\\\\n\\\",what);free(global2);free(global1);/* Sleep statements added to expand timing window for race condition */sleep(10);exit(0);}int main (int argc,char* argv[]) {what=argv[1];global1=strdup(argv[2]);global2=malloc(340);signal(SIGHUP,sh);signal(SIGTERM,sh);/* Sleep statements added to expand timing window for race condition */sleep(10);exit(0);}However, the following sequence of events may result in a double-free (CWE-415):a SIGHUP is delivered to the processsh() is invoked to process the SIGHUPThis first invocation of sh() reaches the point where global1 is freedAt this point, a SIGTERM is sent to the processthe second invocation of sh() might do another free of global1this results in a double-free (CWE-415)This is just one possible exploitation of the above code. As another example, the syslog call may use malloc calls which are not async-signal safe. This could cause corruption of the heap management structures.

Given enough time, the Finalize() method for BufferReader should eventually call Close(), but there is no guarantee as to how long this action will take. In fact, there is no guarantee that Finalize() will ever be invoked. In a busy environment, the Operating System could use up all of the available file handles before the Close() function is called.(bad code)Example Language:Javaprivate void processFile(string fName){BufferReader fil = new BufferReader(new FileReader(fName));String line;while ((line = fil.ReadLine()) != null){processLine(line);}}The good code example simply adds an explicit call to the Close() function when the system is done using the file. Within a simple example such as this the problem is easy to see and fix. In a real system, the problem may be considerably more obscure.(good code)Example Language:Javaprivate void processFile(string fName){BufferReader fil = new BufferReader(new FileReader(fName));String line;while ((line = fil.ReadLine()) != null){processLine(line);}fil.Close();}Example 2The following code attempts to open a new connection to a database, process the results returned by the database, and close the allocated SqlConnection object.(bad code)Example Language:C#SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(connString);SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(queryString);cmd.Connection = conn;conn.Open();SqlDataReader rdr = cmd.ExecuteReader();HarvestResults(rdr);conn.Connection.Close();The problem with the above code is that if an exception occurs while executing the SQL or processing the results, the SqlConnection object is not closed. If this happens often enough, the database will run out of available cursors and not be able to execute any more SQL queries.Example 3This code attempts to open a connection to a database and catches any exceptions that may occur.(bad code)Example Language:Javatry {Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(some_connection_string);}catch ( Exception e ) {log( e );}If an exception occurs after establishing the database connection and before the same connection closes, the pool of database connections may become exhausted. If the number of available connections is exceeded, other users cannot access this resource, effectively denying access to the application.Example 4Under normal conditions the following C# code executes a database query, processes the results returned by the database, and closes the allocated SqlConnection object. But if an exception occurs while executing the SQL or processing the results, the SqlConnection object is not closed. If this happens often enough, the database will run out of available cursors and not be able to execute any more SQL queries.(bad code)Example Language:C#...SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(connString);SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(queryString);cmd.Connection = conn;conn.Open();SqlDataReader rdr = cmd.ExecuteReader();HarvestResults(rdr);conn.Connection.Close();...Example 5The following C function does not close the file handle it opens if an error occurs.

For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.\\n\\nApplicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.\\n\\nWhen full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to \\\"sniff\\\" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.\",\n    \"Alternate Terms\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Relationships\": \"Relevant to the view \\\"Research Concepts\\\" (CWE-1000)NatureTypeIDNameChildOf311Missing Encryption of Sensitive DataParentOf5J2EE Misconfiguration: Data Transmission Without EncryptionParentOf614Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' AttributeRelevant to the view \\\"Software Development\\\" (CWE-699)NatureTypeIDNameMemberOf199Information Management ErrorsRelevant to the view \\\"Hardware Design\\\" (CWE-1194)NatureTypeIDNameMemberOf1207Debug and Test ProblemsRelevant to the view \\\"Weaknesses for Simplified Mapping of Published Vulnerabilities\\\" (CWE-1003)NatureTypeIDNameChildOf311Missing Encryption of Sensitive DataRelevant to the view \\\"Architectural Concepts\\\" (CWE-1008)NatureTypeIDNameMemberOf1013Encrypt Data\",\n    \"Modes of Introduction\": \"PhaseNote\\n\\nArchitecture and DesignOMISSION: This weakness is caused by missing a security tactic during the architecture and design phase.\\n\\nArchitecture and DesignFor hardware, this may be introduced when design does not plan for an attacker having physical access while a legitimate user is remotely operating the device.\\n\\nOperation\\n\\nSystem Configuration\",\n    \"Applicable Platforms\": \"Languages\\n\\nClass: Not Language-Specific(Undetermined Prevalence)\\n\\nTechnologies\\n\\nClass: Cloud Computing(Undetermined Prevalence)\\n\\nClass: Mobile(Undetermined Prevalence)\\n\\nClass: ICS/OT(Often Prevalent)\\n\\nClass: System on Chip(Undetermined Prevalence)\\n\\nTest/Debug Hardware(Often Prevalent)\",\n    \"Common Consequences\": \"ScopeImpactLikelihood\\n\\nIntegrityConfidentialityTechnical Impact:Read Application Data; Modify Files or DirectoriesAnyone can read the information by gaining access to the channel being used for communication.\",\n    \"Likelihood of Exploit\": \"High\",\n    \"Demonstrative Examples\": \"Example 1The following code attempts to establish a connection to a site to communicate sensitive information.(bad code)Example Language:Javatry {URL u = new URL(\\\"http://www.secret.example.org/\\\");HttpURLConnection hu = (HttpURLConnection) u.openConnection();hu.setRequestMethod(\\\"PUT\\\");hu.connect();OutputStream os = hu.getOutputStream();hu.disconnect();}catch (IOException e) {//...}Though a connection is successfully made, the connection is unencrypted and it is possible that all sensitive data sent to or received from the server will be read by unintended actors.Example 2In 2022, the OT:ICEFALL study examined products by 10 different Operational Technology (OT) vendors. The researchers reported 56 vulnerabilities and said that the products were \\\"insecure by design\\\" [REF-1283]. If exploited, these vulnerabilities often allowed adversaries to change how the products operated, ranging from denial of service to changing the code that the products executed. Since these products were often used in industries such as power, electrical, water, and others, there could even be safety implications.Multiple vendors used cleartext transmission of sensitive information in their OT products.Example 3A TAP accessible register is read/written by a JTAG based tool, for internal use by authorized users. However, an adversary can connect a probing device and collect the values from the unencrypted channel connecting the JTAG interface to the authorized user, if no additional protections are employed.Example 4The following Azure CLI command lists the properties of a particular storage account:(informative)Example Language:Shellaz storage account show -g {ResourceGroupName} -n {StorageAccountName}The JSON result might be:(bad code)Example Language:JSON{\\\"name\\\": \\\"{StorageAccountName}\\\",\\\"enableHttpsTrafficOnly\\\": false,\\\"type\\\": \\\"Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts\\\"}The enableHttpsTrafficOnly value is set to false, because the default setting for Secure transfer is set to Disabled.

The secure transfer setting can be enabled using Azure's Portal (GUI) or programmatically by setting the enableHttpsTrafficOnly property to True on the storage account, such as:(good code)Example Language:Shellaz storage account update -g {ResourceGroupName} -n {StorageAccountName} --https-only trueThe change can be confirmed from the result by verifying that the enableHttpsTrafficOnly value is true:(good code)Example Language:JSON{\\\"name\\\": \\\"{StorageAccountName}\\\",\\\"enableHttpsTrafficOnly\\\": true,\\\"type\\\": \\\"Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts\\\"}Note: to enable secure transfer using Azure's Portal instead of the command line:Open the Create storage account pane in the Azure portal.In the Advanced page, select the Enable secure transfer checkbox.\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2022-29519Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) sends sensitive information in plaintext, including passwords and session tokens.CVE-2022-30312Building Controller uses a protocol that transmits authentication credentials in plaintext.CVE-2022-31204Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) sends password in plaintext.CVE-2002-1949Passwords transmitted in cleartext.CVE-2008-4122Chain: Use of HTTPS cookie without \\\"secure\\\" flag causes it to be transmitted across unencrypted HTTP.CVE-2008-3289Product sends password hash in cleartext in violation of intended policy.CVE-2008-4390Remote management feature sends sensitive information including passwords in cleartext.CVE-2007-5626Backup routine sends password in cleartext in email.CVE-2004-1852Product transmits Blowfish encryption key in cleartext.CVE-2008-0374Printer sends configuration information, including administrative password, in cleartext.CVE-2007-4961Chain: cleartext transmission of the MD5 hash of password enables attacks against a server that is susceptible to replay (CWE-294).CVE-2007-4786Product sends passwords in cleartext to a log server.CVE-2005-3140Product sends file with cleartext passwords in e-mail message intended for diagnostic purposes.\",\n    \"References\": \"[REF-271] OWASP. \\\"Top 10 2007-Insecure Communications\\\". 2007. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2007-A9>.[REF-7] Michael Howard and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDavid LeBlanc. \\\"Writing Secure Code\\\".

This technique is useful in cases when source code is unavailable, if the software was not developed by you, or if you want to verify that the build phase did not introduce any new weaknesses. Examples include debuggers that directly attach to the running process; system-call tracing utilities such as truss (Solaris) and strace (Linux); system activity monitors such as FileMon, RegMon, Process Monitor, and other Sysinternals utilities (Windows); and sniffers and protocol analyzers that monitor network traffic.Attach the monitor to the process, trigger the feature that sends the data, and look for the presence or absence of common cryptographic functions in the call tree. Monitor the network and determine if the data packets contain readable commands. Tools exist for detecting if certain encodings are in use.

This will result in a very small list to be allocated instead. If the subsequent code operates on the list as if it were num_imgs long, it may result in many types of out-of-bounds problems (CWE-119).Example 2The following code excerpt from OpenSSH 3.3 demonstrates a classic case of integer overflow:(bad code)Example Language:Cnresp = packet_get_int();if (nresp > 0) {response = xmalloc(nresp*sizeof(char*));for (i = 0; i < nresp; i++) response[i] = packet_get_string(NULL);}If nresp has the value 1073741824 and sizeof(char*) has its typical value of 4, then the result of the operation nresp*sizeof(char*) overflows, and the argument to xmalloc() will be 0. Most malloc() implementations will happily allocate a 0-byte buffer, causing the subsequent loop iterations to overflow the heap buffer response.Example 3Integer overflows can be complicated and difficult to detect. The following example is an attempt to show how an integer overflow may lead to undefined looping behavior:(bad code)Example Language:Cshort int bytesRec = 0;char buf[SOMEBIGNUM];while(bytesRec < MAXGET) {bytesRec += getFromInput(buf+bytesRec);}In the above case, it is entirely possible that bytesRec may overflow, continuously creating a lower number than MAXGET and also overwriting the first MAXGET-1 bytes of buf.Example 4In this example the method determineFirstQuarterRevenue is used to determine the first quarter revenue for an accounting/business application. The method retrieves the monthly sales totals for the first three months of the year, calculates the first quarter sales totals from the monthly sales totals, calculates the first quarter revenue based on the first quarter sales, and finally saves the first quarter revenue results to the database.(bad code)Example Language:C#define JAN 1#define FEB 2#define MAR 3short getMonthlySales(int month) {...}float calculateRevenueForQuarter(short quarterSold) {...}int determineFirstQuarterRevenue() {// Variable for sales revenue for the quarterfloat quarterRevenue = 0.0f;short JanSold = getMonthlySales(JAN); /* Get sales in January */short FebSold = getMonthlySales(FEB); /* Get sales in February */short MarSold = getMonthlySales(MAR); /* Get sales in March */// Calculate quarterly totalshort quarterSold = JanSold + FebSold + MarSold;// Calculate the total revenue for the quarterquarterRevenue = calculateRevenueForQuarter(quarterSold);saveFirstQuarterRevenue(quarterRevenue);return 0;}However, in this example the primitive type short int is used for both the monthly and the quarterly sales variables. In C the short int primitive type has a maximum value of 32768. This creates a potential integer overflow if the value for the three monthly sales adds up to more than the maximum value for the short int primitive type. An integer overflow can lead to data corruption, unexpected behavior, infinite loops and system crashes. To correct the situation the appropriate primitive type should be used, as in the example below, and/or provide some validation mechanism to ensure that the maximum value for the primitive type is not exceeded.(good code)Example Language:C...float calculateRevenueForQuarter(long quarterSold) {...}int determineFirstQuarterRevenue() {...// Calculate quarterly totallong quarterSold = JanSold + FebSold + MarSold;// Calculate the total revenue for the quarterquarterRevenue = calculateRevenueForQuarter(quarterSold);...}Note that an integer overflow could also occur if the quarterSold variable has a primitive type long but the method calculateRevenueForQuarter has a parameter of type short.\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2021-43537Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190).

Because memcpy() assumes that the value is unsigned, it will be interpreted as MAXINT-1 (CWE-195), and therefore will copy far more memory than is likely available to the destination buffer (CWE-787,CWE-788).Example 3In the following example, the source character string is copied to the dest character string using the method strncpy.(bad code)Example Language:C...char source[21] = \\\"the character string\\\";char dest[12];strncpy(dest, source, sizeof(source)-1);...However, in the call to strncpy the source character string is used within the sizeof call to determine the number of characters to copy. This will create a buffer overflow as the size of the source character string is greater than the dest character string. The dest character string should be used within the sizeof call to ensure that the correct number of characters are copied, as shown below.(good code)Example Language:C...char source[21] = \\\"the character string\\\";char dest[12];strncpy(dest, source, sizeof(dest)-1);...Example 4In this example, the method outputFilenameToLog outputs a filename to a log file. The method arguments include a pointer to a character string containing the file name and an integer for the number of characters in the string. The filename is copied to a buffer where the buffer size is set to a maximum size for inputs to the log file. The method then calls another method to save the contents of the buffer to the log file.(bad code)Example Language:C#define LOG_INPUT_SIZE 40// saves the file name to a log fileint outputFilenameToLog(char *filename, int length) {int success;// buffer with size set to maximum size for input to log filechar buf[LOG_INPUT_SIZE];// copy filename to bufferstrncpy(buf, filename, length);// save to log filesuccess = saveToLogFile(buf);return success;}However, in this case the string copy method, strncpy, mistakenly uses the length method argument to determine the number of characters to copy rather than using the size of the local character string, buf. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the number of characters contained in character string pointed to by filename is larger then the number of characters allowed for the local character string. The string copy method should use the buf character string within a sizeof call to ensure that only characters up to the size of the buf array are copied to avoid a buffer overflow, as shown below.(good code)Example Language:C...// copy filename to bufferstrncpy(buf, filename, sizeof(buf)-1);...Example 5Windows provides the MultiByteToWideChar(), WideCharToMultiByte(), UnicodeToBytes(), and BytesToUnicode() functions to convert between arbitrary multibyte (usually ANSI) character strings and Unicode (wide character) strings. The size arguments to these functions are specified in different units, (one in bytes, the other in characters) making their use prone to error.In a multibyte character string, each character occupies a varying number of bytes, and therefore the size of such strings is most easily specified as a total number of bytes. In Unicode, however, characters are always a fixed size, and string lengths are typically given by the number of characters they contain. Mistakenly specifying the wrong units in a size argument can lead to a buffer overflow.The following function takes a username specified as a multibyte string and a pointer to a structure for user information and populates the structure with information about the specified user. Since Windows authentication uses Unicode for usernames, the username argument is first converted from a multibyte string to a Unicode string.(bad code)Example Language:Cvoid getUserInfo(char *username, struct _USER_INFO_2 info){WCHAR unicodeUser[UNLEN+1];MultiByteToWideChar(CP_ACP, 0, username, -1, unicodeUser, sizeof(unicodeUser));NetUserGetInfo(NULL, unicodeUser, 2, (LPBYTE *)&info);}This function incorrectly passes the size of unicodeUser in bytes instead of characters. The call to MultiByteToWideChar() can therefore write up to (UNLEN+1)*sizeof(WCHAR) wide characters, or (UNLEN+1)*sizeof(WCHAR)*sizeof(WCHAR) bytes, to the unicodeUser array, which has only (UNLEN+1)*sizeof(WCHAR) bytes allocated.If the username string contains more than UNLEN characters, the call to MultiByteToWideChar() will overflow the buffer unicodeUser.\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2011-1959Chain: large length value causes buffer over-read (CWE-126)CVE-2011-1848Use of packet length field to make a calculation, then copy into a fixed-size bufferCVE-2011-0105Chain: retrieval of length value from an uninitialized memory locationCVE-2011-0606Crafted length value in document reader leads to buffer overflowCVE-2011-0651SSL server overflow when the sum of multiple length fields exceeds a given valueCVE-2010-4156Language interpreter API function doesn't validate length argument, leading to information exposure\",\n    \"References\": \"[REF-7] Michael Howard and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDavid LeBlanc. \\\"Writing Secure Code\\\".

Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer.Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignStrategy:  Libraries or FrameworksUse a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.Note:This is not a complete solution, since many buffer overflows are not related to strings.\\n\\nPhases:  Operation; Build and CompilationStrategy:  Environment HardeningUse automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking.D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail.Effectiveness: Defense in DepthNote:This is not necessarily a complete solution, since these mechanisms only detect certain types of overflows. In addition, the result is still a denial of service, since the typical response is to exit the application.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationConsider adhering to the following rules when allocating and managing an application's memory:Double check that the buffer is as large as specified.When using functions that accept a number of bytes to copy, such as strncpy(), be aware that if the destination buffer size is equal to the source buffer size, it may not NULL-terminate the string.Check buffer boundaries if accessing the buffer in a loop and make sure there is no danger of writing past the allocated space.If necessary, truncate all input strings to a reasonable length before passing them to the copy and concatenation functions.\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignFor any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoidCWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.\\n\\nPhases:  Operation; Build and CompilationStrategy:  Environment HardeningRun or compile the software using features or extensions that randomly arrange the positions of a program's executable and libraries in memory. Because this makes the addresses unpredictable, it can prevent an attacker from reliably jumping to exploitable code.Examples include Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) [REF-58] [REF-60] and Position-Independent Executables (PIE) [REF-64]. Imported modules may be similarly realigned if their default memory addresses conflict with other modules, in a process known as \\\"rebasing\\\" (for Windows) and \\\"prelinking\\\" (for Linux) [REF-1332] using randomly generated addresses. ASLR for libraries cannot be used in conjunction with prelink since it would require relocating the libraries at run-time, defeating the whole purpose of prelinking.For more information on these techniques see D3-SAOR (Segment Address Offset Randomization) from D3FEND [REF-1335].Effectiveness: Defense in DepthNote:These techniques do not provide a complete solution. For instance, exploits frequently use a bug that discloses memory addresses in order to maximize reliability of code execution [REF-1337]. It has also been shown that a side-channel attack can bypass ASLR [REF-1333]\\n\\nPhase:  OperationStrategy:  Environment HardeningUse a CPU and operating system that offers Data Execution Protection (using hardware NX or XD bits) or the equivalent techniques that simulate this feature in software, such as PaX [REF-60] [REF-61]. These techniques ensure that any instruction executed is exclusively at a memory address that is part of the code segment.For more information on these techniques see D3-PSEP (Process Segment Execution Prevention) from D3FEND [REF-1336].Effectiveness: Defense in DepthNote:This is not a complete solution, since buffer overflows could be used to overwrite nearby variables to modify the software's state in dangerous ways. In addition, it cannot be used in cases in which self-modifying code is required. Finally, an attack could still cause a denial of service, since the typical response is to exit the application.\\n\\nPhases:  Architecture and Design; OperationStrategy:  Environment HardeningRun your code using the lowest privileges that are required to accomplish the necessary tasks [REF-76]. If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a single task. That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the product or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.\\n\\nPhases:  Architecture and Design; OperationStrategy:  Sandbox or JailRun the code in a \\\"jail\\\" or similar sandbox environment that enforces strict boundaries between the process and the operating system. This may effectively restrict which files can be accessed in a particular directory or which commands can be executed by the software.OS-level examples include the Unix chroot jail, AppArmor, and SELinux. In general, managed code may provide some protection. For example, java.io.FilePermission in the Java SecurityManager allows the software to specify restrictions on file operations.This may not be a feasible solution, and it only limits the impact to the operating system; the rest of the application may still be subject to compromise.Be careful to avoidCWE-243and other weaknesses related to jails.Effectiveness: LimitedNote:The effectiveness of this mitigation depends on the prevention capabilities of the specific sandbox or jail being used and might only help to reduce the scope of an attack, such as restricting the attacker to certain system calls or limiting the portion of the file system that can be accessed.\",\n    \"Weakness Ordinalities\": \"OrdinalityDescriptionResultant(where the weakness is typically related to the presence of some other weaknesses)Primary(where the weakness exists independent of other weaknesses)\",\n    \"Detection Methods\": \"Automated Static AnalysisThis weakness can often be detected using automated static analysis tools.

For example, an analysis tool might report buffer overflows that originate from command line arguments in a program that is not expected to run with setuid or other special privileges.Effectiveness: HighNote:Detection techniques for buffer-related errors are more mature than for most other weakness types.Automated Dynamic AnalysisThis weakness can be detected using dynamic tools and techniques that interact with the product using large test suites with many diverse inputs, such as fuzz testing (fuzzing), robustness testing, and fault injection. The product's operation may slow down, but it should not become unstable, crash, or generate incorrect results.Effectiveness: ModerateNote:Without visibility into the code, black box methods may not be able to sufficiently distinguish this weakness from others, requiring manual methods to diagnose the underlying problem.Manual AnalysisManual analysis can be useful for finding this weakness, but it might not achieve desired code coverage within limited time constraints.

Most of these functions are vulnerable to various forms of attacks.The functions designed to aid in the creation of temporary files can be broken into two groups based whether they simply provide a filename or actually open a new file. - Group 1: \\\"Unique\\\" Filenames: The first group of C Library and WinAPI functions designed to help with the process of creating temporary files do so by generating a unique file name for a new temporary file, which the program is then supposed to open. This group includes C Library functions like tmpnam(), tempnam(), mktemp() and their C++ equivalents prefaced with an _ (underscore) as well as the GetTempFileName() function from the Windows API. This group of functions suffers from an underlying race condition on the filename chosen. Although the functions guarantee that the filename is unique at the time it is selected, there is no mechanism to prevent another process or an attacker from creating a file with the same name after it is selected but before the application attempts to open the file. Beyond the risk of a legitimate collision caused by another call to the same function, there is a high probability that an attacker will be able to create a malicious collision because the filenames generated by these functions are not sufficiently randomized to make them difficult to guess. If a file with the selected name is created, then depending on how the file is opened the existing contents or access permissions of the file may remain intact. If the existing contents of the file are malicious in nature, an attacker may be able to inject dangerous data into the application when it reads data back from the temporary file. If an attacker pre-creates the file with relaxed access permissions, then data stored in the temporary file by the application may be accessed, modified or corrupted by an attacker. On Unix based systems an even more insidious attack is possible if the attacker pre-creates the file as a link to another important file. Then, if the application truncates or writes data to the file, it may unwittingly perform damaging operations for the attacker. This is an especially serious threat if the program operates with elevated permissions. Finally, in the best case the file will be opened with the a call to open() using the O_CREAT and O_EXCL flags or to CreateFile() using the CREATE_NEW attribute, which will fail if the file already exists and therefore prevent the types of attacks described above. However, if an attacker is able to accurately predict a sequence of temporary file names, then the application may be prevented from opening necessary temporary storage causing a denial of service (DoS) attack. This type of attack would not be difficult to mount given the small amount of randomness used in the selection of the filenames generated by these functions. - Group 2: \\\"Unique\\\" Files: The second group of C Library functions attempts to resolve some of the security problems related to temporary files by not only generating a unique file name, but also opening the file. This group includes C Library functions like tmpfile() and its C++ equivalents prefaced with an _ (underscore), as well as the slightly better-behaved C Library function mkstemp(). The tmpfile() style functions construct a unique filename and open it in the same way that fopen() would if passed the flags \\\"wb+\\\", that is, as a binary file in read/write mode. If the file already exists, tmpfile() will truncate it to size zero, possibly in an attempt to assuage the security concerns mentioned earlier regarding the race condition that exists between the selection of a supposedly unique filename and the subsequent opening of the selected file. However, this behavior clearly does not solve the function's security problems. First, an attacker can pre-create the file with relaxed access-permissions that will likely be retained by the file opened by tmpfile(). Furthermore, on Unix based systems if the attacker pre-creates the file as a link to another important file, the application may use its possibly elevated permissions to truncate that file, thereby doing damage on behalf of the attacker. Finally, if tmpfile() does create a new file, the access permissions applied to that file will vary from one operating system to another, which can leave application data vulnerable even if an attacker is unable to predict the filename to be used in advance. Finally, mkstemp() is a reasonably safe way create temporary files. It will attempt to create and open a unique file based on a filename template provided by the user combined with a series of randomly generated characters. If it is unable to create such a file, it will fail and return -1. On modern systems the file is opened using mode 0600, which means the file will be secure from tampering unless the user explicitly changes its access permissions. However, mkstemp() still suffers from the use of predictable file names and can leave an application vulnerable to denial of service attacks if an attacker causes mkstemp() to fail by predicting and pre-creating the filenames to be used.\",\n    \"Taxonomy Mappings\": \"Mapped Taxonomy NameNode IDFitMapped Node Name7 Pernicious KingdomsInsecure Temporary FileCERT C Secure CodingCON33-CImpreciseAvoid race conditions when using library functionsThe CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011)FIO00-JDo not operate on files in shared directories\",\n    \"Related Attack Patterns\": \"CAPEC-IDAttack Pattern NameCAPEC-149Explore for Predictable Temporary File NamesCAPEC-155Screen Temporary Files for Sensitive Information\"\n}"}]}

All of these, however, involve the introduction of buffer overflow conditions in order to reach an exploitable state.The first of these issues takes place when the output of a wide or multi-byte character string, string-length function is used as a size for the allocation of memory. While this will result in an output of the number of characters in the string, note that the characters are most likely not a single byte, as they are with standard character strings. So, using the size returned as the size sent to new or malloc and copying the string to this newly allocated memory will result in a buffer overflow.Another common way these strings are misused involves the mixing of standard string and wide or multi-byte string functions on a single string. Invariably, this mismatched information will result in the creation of a possibly exploitable buffer overflow condition.\",\n    \"Applicable Platforms\": \"Languages\\n\\nC(Undetermined Prevalence)\\n\\nC++(Undetermined Prevalence)\",\n    \"Common Consequences\": \"ScopeImpactLikelihood\\n\\nIntegrityConfidentialityAvailabilityTechnical Impact:Execute Unauthorized Code or CommandsThis weakness may lead to a buffer overflow.

However, if an attacker is able to fully control the value of buf.nameID, then buf.name could contain an arbitrary pointer, leading to out-of-bounds reads or writes.Example 2The following PHP code accepts a value, adds 5, and prints the sum.(bad code)Example Language:PHP$value = $_GET['value'];$sum = $value + 5;echo \\\"value parameter is '$value'<p>\\\";echo \\\"SUM is $sum\\\";When called with the following query string:value=123the program calculates the sum and prints out:SUM is 128However, the attacker could supply a query string such as:value[]=123The \\\"[]\\\" array syntax causes $value to be treated as an array type, which then generates a fatal error when calculating $sum:Fatal error: Unsupported operand types in program.php on line 2Example 3The following Perl code is intended to look up the privileges for user ID's between 0 and 3, by performing an access of the $UserPrivilegeArray reference. It is expected that only userID 3 is an admin (since this is listed in the third element of the array).(bad code)Example Language:Perlmy $UserPrivilegeArray = [\\\"user\\\", \\\"user\\\", \\\"admin\\\", \\\"user\\\"];my $userID = get_current_user_ID();if ($UserPrivilegeArray eq \\\"user\\\") {print \\\"Regular user!\\\\n\\\";}else {print \\\"Admin!\\\\n\\\";}print \\\"\\\\$UserPrivilegeArray = $UserPrivilegeArray\\\\n\\\";In this case, the programmer intended to use \\\"$UserPrivilegeArray->{$userID}\\\" to access the proper position in the array. But because the subscript was omitted, the \\\"user\\\" string was compared to the scalar representation of the $UserPrivilegeArray reference, which might be of the form \\\"ARRAY(0x229e8)\\\" or similar.Since the logic also \\\"fails open\\\" (CWE-636), the result of this bug is that all users are assigned administrator privileges.While this is a forced example, it demonstrates how type confusion can have security consequences, even in memory-safe languages.\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2010-4577Type confusion in CSS sequence leads to out-of-bounds read.CVE-2011-0611Size inconsistency allows code execution, first discovered when it was actively exploited in-the-wild.CVE-2010-0258Improperly-parsed file containing records of different types leads to code execution when a memory location is interpreted as a different object than intended.\",\n    \"References\": \"[REF-811] Mark Dowd, Ryan Smith\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand David Dewey. \\\"Attacking Interoperability\\\". \\\"Type Confusion Vulnerabilities,\\\" page 59. 2009. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<http://hustlelabs.com/stuff/bh2009_dowd_smith_dewey.pdf>.URL validated: 2023-04-07.[REF-62] Mark Dowd, John McDonald\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand Justin Schuh. \\\"The Art of Software Security Assessment\\\".

Because the function is declared to return an unsigned int, amount will be implicitly converted to unsigned.(bad code)Example Language:Cunsigned int readdata () {int amount = 0;...if (result == ERROR)amount = -1;...return amount;}If the error condition in the code above is met, then the return value of readdata() will be 4,294,967,295 on a system that uses 32-bit integers.Example 2In this example, depending on the return value of accecssmainframe(), the variable amount can hold a negative value when it is returned. Because the function is declared to return an unsigned value, amount will be implicitly cast to an unsigned number.(bad code)Example Language:Cunsigned int readdata () {int amount = 0;...amount = accessmainframe();...return amount;}If the return value of accessmainframe() is -1, then the return value of readdata() will be 4,294,967,295 on a system that uses 32-bit integers.Example 3The following code is intended to read an incoming packet from a socket and extract one or more headers.(bad code)Example Language:CDataPacket *packet;int numHeaders;PacketHeader *headers;sock=AcceptSocketConnection();ReadPacket(packet, sock);numHeaders =packet->headers;if (numHeaders > 100) {ExitError(\\\"too many headers!\\\");}headers = malloc(numHeaders * sizeof(PacketHeader);ParsePacketHeaders(packet, headers);The code performs a check to make sure that the packet does not contain too many headers. However, numHeaders is defined as a signed int, so it could be negative. If the incoming packet specifies a value such as -3, then the malloc calculation will generate a negative number (say, -300 if each header can be a maximum of 100 bytes). When this result is provided to malloc(), it is first converted to a size_t type. This conversion then produces a large value such as 4294966996, which may cause malloc() to fail or to allocate an extremely large amount of memory (CWE-195). With the appropriate negative numbers, an attacker could trick malloc() into using a very small positive number, which then allocates a buffer that is much smaller than expected, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.Example 4This example processes user input comprised of a series of variable-length structures. The first 2 bytes of input dictate the size of the structure to be processed.(bad code)Example Language:Cchar* processNext(char* strm) {char buf[512];short len = *(short*) strm;strm += sizeof(len);if (len <= 512) {memcpy(buf, strm, len);process(buf);return strm + len;}else {return -1;}}The programmer has set an upper bound on the structure size: if it is larger than 512, the input will not be processed. The problem is that len is a signed short, so the check against the maximum structure length is done with signed values, but len is converted to an unsigned integer for the call to memcpy() and the negative bit will be extended to result in a huge value for the unsigned integer. If len is negative, then it will appear that the structure has an appropriate size (the if branch will be taken), but the amount of memory copied by memcpy() will be quite large, and the attacker will be able to overflow the stack with data in strm.Example 5In the following example, it is possible to request that memcpy move a much larger segment of memory than assumed:(bad code)Example Language:Cint returnChunkSize(void *) {/* if chunk info is valid, return the size of usable memory,* else, return -1 to indicate an error*/...}int main() {...memcpy(destBuf, srcBuf, (returnChunkSize(destBuf)-1));...}If returnChunkSize() happens to encounter an error it will return -1. Notice that the return value is not checked before the memcpy operation (CWE-252), so -1 can be passed as the size argument to memcpy() (CWE-805). Because memcpy() assumes that the value is unsigned, it will be interpreted as MAXINT-1 (CWE-195), and therefore will copy far more memory than is likely available to the destination buffer (CWE-787,CWE-788).Example 6This example shows a typical attempt to parse a string with an error resulting from a difference in assumptions between the caller to a function and the function's action.(bad code)Example Language:Cint proc_msg(char *s, int msg_len){// Note space at the end of the string - assume all strings have preamble with spaceint pre_len = sizeof(\\\"preamble: \\\");char buf[pre_len - msg_len];... Do processing here if we get this far}char *s = \\\"preamble: message\\\\n\\\";char *sl = strchr(s, ':');        // Number of characters up to ':' (not including space)int jnklen = sl == NULL ? 0 : sl - s;    // If undefined pointer, use zero lengthint ret_val = proc_msg (\\\"s\\\",  jnklen);    // Violate assumption of preamble length, end up with negative value, blow out stackThe buffer length ends up being -1, resulting in a blown out stack. The space character after the colon is included in the function calculation, but not in the caller's calculation. This, unfortunately, is not usually so obvious but exists in an obtuse series of calculations.\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2007-4268Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)\",\n    \"References\": \"[REF-62] Mark Dowd, John McDonald\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand Justin Schuh. \\\"The Art of Software Security Assessment\\\".

This will create a buffer overflow as the size of the source character string is greater than the dest character string. The dest character string should be used within the sizeof call to ensure that the correct number of characters are copied, as shown below.(good code)Example Language:C...char source[21] = \\\"the character string\\\";char dest[12];strncpy(dest, source, sizeof(dest)-1);...Example 2In this example, the method outputFilenameToLog outputs a filename to a log file. The method arguments include a pointer to a character string containing the file name and an integer for the number of characters in the string. The filename is copied to a buffer where the buffer size is set to a maximum size for inputs to the log file. The method then calls another method to save the contents of the buffer to the log file.(bad code)Example Language:C#define LOG_INPUT_SIZE 40// saves the file name to a log fileint outputFilenameToLog(char *filename, int length) {int success;// buffer with size set to maximum size for input to log filechar buf[LOG_INPUT_SIZE];// copy filename to bufferstrncpy(buf, filename, length);// save to log filesuccess = saveToLogFile(buf);return success;}However, in this case the string copy method, strncpy, mistakenly uses the length method argument to determine the number of characters to copy rather than using the size of the local character string, buf. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the number of characters contained in character string pointed to by filename is larger then the number of characters allowed for the local character string. The string copy method should use the buf character string within a sizeof call to ensure that only characters up to the size of the buf array are copied to avoid a buffer overflow, as shown below.(good code)Example Language:C...// copy filename to bufferstrncpy(buf, filename, sizeof(buf)-1);...\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"N/A\",\n    \"References\": \"[REF-56] Microsoft. \\\"Using the Strsafe.h Functions\\\". <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/menurc/strsafe-ovw?redirectedfrom=MSDN>.URL validated: 2023-04-07.[REF-57] Matt Messier and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJohn Viega. \\\"Safe C String Library v1.0.3\\\". <http://www.gnu-darwin.org/www001/ports-1.5a-CURRENT/devel/safestr/work/safestr-1.0.3/doc/safestr.html>.URL validated: 2023-04-07.[REF-58] Michael Howard. \\\"Address Space Layout Randomization in Windows Vista\\\". <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/michael_howard/address-space-layout-randomization-in-windows-vista>.URL validated: 2023-04-07.[REF-59] Arjan van de Ven. \\\"Limiting buffer overflows with ExecShield\\\". <https://archive.is/saAFo>.URL validated: 2023-04-07.[REF-60] \\\"PaX\\\". <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_space_protection#PaX>.URL validated: 2023-04-07.[REF-61] Microsoft. \\\"Understanding DEP as a mitigation technology part 1\\\". <https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2009/06/understanding-dep-as-a-mitigation-technology-part-1/>.URL validated: 2023-04-07.[REF-64] Grant Murphy. \\\"Position Independent Executables (PIE)\\\".

Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Viega, and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft. This is not a complete solution, since many buffer overflows are not related to strings.\\n\\nPhases:  Operation; Build and CompilationStrategy:  Environment HardeningUse automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking.D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail.Effectiveness: Defense in DepthNote:This is not necessarily a complete solution, since these mechanisms only detect certain types of overflows. In addition, the result is still a denial of service, since the typical response is to exit the application.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationProgrammers should adhere to the following rules when allocating and managing their applications memory: Double check that your buffer is as large as you specify. When using functions that accept a number of bytes to copy, such as strncpy(), be aware that if the destination buffer size is equal to the source buffer size, it may not NULL-terminate the string. Check buffer boundaries if calling this function in a loop and make sure there is no danger of writing past the allocated space. Truncate all input strings to a reasonable length before passing them to the copy and concatenation functions\\n\\nPhases:  Operation; Build and CompilationStrategy:  Environment HardeningRun or compile the software using features or extensions that randomly arrange the positions of a program's executable and libraries in memory. Because this makes the addresses unpredictable, it can prevent an attacker from reliably jumping to exploitable code.Examples include Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) [REF-58] [REF-60] and Position-Independent Executables (PIE) [REF-64]. Imported modules may be similarly realigned if their default memory addresses conflict with other modules, in a process known as \\\"rebasing\\\" (for Windows) and \\\"prelinking\\\" (for Linux) [REF-1332] using randomly generated addresses. ASLR for libraries cannot be used in conjunction with prelink since it would require relocating the libraries at run-time, defeating the whole purpose of prelinking.For more information on these techniques see D3-SAOR (Segment Address Offset Randomization) from D3FEND [REF-1335].Effectiveness: Defense in DepthNote:These techniques do not provide a complete solution. For instance, exploits frequently use a bug that discloses memory addresses in order to maximize reliability of code execution [REF-1337]. It has also been shown that a side-channel attack can bypass ASLR [REF-1333]\\n\\nPhase:  OperationStrategy:  Environment HardeningUse a CPU and operating system that offers Data Execution Protection (using hardware NX or XD bits) or the equivalent techniques that simulate this feature in software, such as PaX [REF-60] [REF-61]. These techniques ensure that any instruction executed is exclusively at a memory address that is part of the code segment.For more information on these techniques see D3-PSEP (Process Segment Execution Prevention) from D3FEND [REF-1336].Effectiveness: Defense in DepthNote:This is not a complete solution, since buffer overflows could be used to overwrite nearby variables to modify the software's state in dangerous ways. In addition, it cannot be used in cases in which self-modifying code is required. Finally, an attack could still cause a denial of service, since the typical response is to exit the application.\\n\\nPhases:  Build and Compilation; OperationMost mitigating technologies at the compiler or OS level to date address only a subset of buffer overflow problems and rarely provide complete protection against even that subset. It is good practice to implement strategies to increase the workload of an attacker, such as leaving the attacker to guess an unknown value that changes every program execution.\",\n    \"Weakness Ordinalities\": \"OrdinalityDescriptionResultant(where the weakness is typically related to the presence of some other weaknesses)Primary(where the weakness exists independent of other weaknesses)\",\n    \"Detection Methods\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Functional Areas\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Affected Resources\": \"Memory\",\n    \"Memberships\": \"NatureTypeIDNameMemberOf1399Comprehensive Categorization: Memory Safety\",\n    \"Vulnerability Mapping Notes\": \"Usage:ALLOWED(this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)Reason:Acceptable-UseRationale:This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.Comments:Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Because operations on double and long are nonatomic in Java, concurrent access may cause unexpected behavior. Thus, all operations on long and double fields should be synchronized.(bad code)Example Language:Javaprivate long someLongValue;public long getLongValue() {return someLongValue;}public void setLongValue(long l) {someLongValue = l;}Example 2This code tries to obtain a lock for a file, then writes to it.(bad code)Example Language:PHPfunction writeToLog($message){$logfile = fopen(\\\"logFile.log\\\", \\\"a\\\");//attempt to get logfile lockif (flock($logfile, LOCK_EX)) {fwrite($logfile,$message);// unlock logfileflock($logfile, LOCK_UN);}else {print \\\"Could not obtain lock on logFile.log, message not recorded\\\\n\\\";}}fclose($logFile);PHP by default will wait indefinitely until a file lock is released. If an attacker is able to obtain the file lock, this code will pause execution, possibly leading to denial of service for other users. Note that in this case, if an attacker can perform an flock() on the file, they may already have privileges to destroy the log file. However, this still impacts the execution of other programs that depend on flock().Example 3The following function attempts to acquire a lock in order to perform operations on a shared resource.(bad code)Example Language:Cvoid f(pthread_mutex_t *mutex) {pthread_mutex_lock(mutex);/* access shared resource */pthread_mutex_unlock(mutex);}However, the code does not check the value returned by pthread_mutex_lock() for errors. If pthread_mutex_lock() cannot acquire the mutex for any reason, the function may introduce a race condition into the program and result in undefined behavior.In order to avoid data races, correctly written programs must check the result of thread synchronization functions and appropriately handle all errors, either by attempting to recover from them or reporting them to higher levels.(good code)Example Language:Cint f(pthread_mutex_t *mutex) {int result;result = pthread_mutex_lock(mutex);if (0 != result)return result;/* access shared resource */return pthread_mutex_unlock(mutex);}Example 4It may seem that the following bit of code achieves thread safety while avoiding unnecessary synchronization...(bad code)Example Language:Javaif (helper == null) {synchronized (this) {if (helper == null) {helper = new Helper();}}}return helper;The programmer wants to guarantee that only one Helper() object is ever allocated, but does not want to pay the cost of synchronization every time this code is called.Suppose that helper is not initialized. Then, thread A sees that helper==null and enters the synchronized block and begins to execute:(bad code)helper = new Helper();If a second thread, thread B, takes over in the middle of this call and helper has not finished running the constructor, then thread B may make calls on helper while its fields hold incorrect values.\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2021-1782Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.CVE-2009-0935Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twiceCVE-2010-4210function in OS kernel unlocks a mutex that was not previously locked, causing a panic or overwrite of arbitrary memory.CVE-2008-4302Chain: OS kernel does not properly handle a failure of a function call (CWE-755), leading to an unlock of a resource that was not locked (CWE-832), with resultant crash.CVE-2009-1243OS kernel performs an unlock in some incorrect circumstances, leading to panic.CVE-2009-2857OS deadlockCVE-2009-1961OS deadlock involving 3 separate functionsCVE-2009-2699deadlock in libraryCVE-2009-4272deadlock triggered by packets that force collisions in a routing tableCVE-2002-1850read/write deadlock between web server and scriptCVE-2004-0174web server deadlock involving multiple listening connectionsCVE-2009-1388multiple simultaneous calls to the same function trigger deadlock.CVE-2006-5158chain: other weakness leads to NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476) or deadlock (CWE-833).CVE-2006-4342deadlock when an operation is performed on a resource while it is being removed.CVE-2006-2374Deadlock in device driver triggered by using file handle of a related device.CVE-2006-2275Deadlock when large number of small messages cannot be processed quickly enough.CVE-2005-3847OS kernel has deadlock triggered by a signal during a core dump.CVE-2005-3106Race condition leads to deadlock.CVE-2005-2456Chain: array index error (CWE-129) leads to deadlock (CWE-833)CVE-2001-0682Program can not execute when attacker obtains a mutex.CVE-2002-1914Program can not execute when attacker obtains a lock on a critical output file.CVE-2002-1915Program can not execute when attacker obtains a lock on a critical output file.CVE-2002-0051Critical file can be opened with exclusive read access by user, preventing application of security policy.

The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.\\n\\nFor example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.\\n\\nOne manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.\",\n    \"Alternate Terms\": \"Insecure Direct Object Reference / IDOR:The \\\"Insecure Direct Object Reference\\\" term, as described in the OWASP Top Ten, is broader than this CWE because it also covers path traversal (CWE-22).

It is subject to the first variant of OS command injection.(bad code)Example Language:PHP$userName = $_POST[\\\"user\\\"];$command = 'ls -l /home/' . $userName;system($command);The $userName variable is not checked for malicious input. An attacker could set the $userName variable to an arbitrary OS command such as:(attack code);rm -rf /Which would result in $command being:(result)ls -l /home/;rm -rf /Since the semi-colon is a command separator in Unix, the OS would first execute the ls command, then the rm command, deleting the entire file system.Also note that this example code is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) and Untrusted Search Path (CWE-426) attacks.Example 2The following simple program accepts a filename as a command line argument and displays the contents of the file back to the user. The program is installed setuid root because it is intended for use as a learning tool to allow system administrators in-training to inspect privileged system files without giving them the ability to modify them or damage the system.(bad code)Example Language:Cint main(int argc, char** argv) {char cmd[CMD_MAX] = \\\"/usr/bin/cat \\\";strcat(cmd, argv[1]);system(cmd);}Because the program runs with root privileges, the call to system() also executes with root privileges. If a user specifies a standard filename, the call works as expected. However, if an attacker passes a string of the form \\\";rm -rf /\\\", then the call to system() fails to execute cat due to a lack of arguments and then plows on to recursively delete the contents of the root partition.Note that if argv[1] is a very long argument, then this issue might also be subject to a buffer overflow (CWE-120).Example 3This example is a web application that intends to perform a DNS lookup of a user-supplied domain name. It is subject to the first variant of OS command injection.(bad code)Example Language:Perluse CGI qw(:standard);$name = param('name');$nslookup = \\\"/path/to/nslookup\\\";print header;if (open($fh, \\\"$nslookup $name|\\\")) {while (<$fh>) {print escapeHTML($_);print \\\"<br>\\\\n\\\";}close($fh);}Suppose an attacker provides a domain name like this:(attack code)cwe.mitre.org%20%3B%20/bin/ls%20-lThe \\\"%3B\\\" sequence decodes to the \\\";\\\" character, and the %20 decodes to a space. The open() statement would then process a string like this:(result)/path/to/nslookup cwe.mitre.org ; /bin/ls -lAs a result, the attacker executes the \\\"/bin/ls -l\\\" command and gets a list of all the files in the program's working directory. The input could be replaced with much more dangerous commands, such as installing a malicious program on the server.Example 4The example below reads the name of a shell script to execute from the system properties. It is subject to the second variant of OS command injection.(bad code)Example Language:JavaString script = System.getProperty(\\\"SCRIPTNAME\\\");if (script != null)System.exec(script);If an attacker has control over this property, then they could modify the property to point to a dangerous program.Example 5In the example below, a method is used to transform geographic coordinates from latitude and longitude format to UTM format. The method gets the input coordinates from a user through a HTTP request and executes a program local to the application server that performs the transformation. The method passes the latitude and longitude coordinates as a command-line option to the external program and will perform some processing to retrieve the results of the transformation and return the resulting UTM coordinates.(bad code)Example Language:Javapublic String coordinateTransformLatLonToUTM(String coordinates){String utmCoords = null;try {String latlonCoords = coordinates;Runtime rt = Runtime.getRuntime();Process exec = rt.exec(\\\"cmd.exe /C latlon2utm.exe -\\\" + latlonCoords);// process results of coordinate transform// ...}catch(Exception e) {...}return utmCoords;}However, the method does not verify that the contents of the coordinates input parameter includes only correctly-formatted latitude and longitude coordinates. If the input coordinates were not validated prior to the call to this method, a malicious user could execute another program local to the application server by appending '&' followed by the command for another program to the end of the coordinate string. The '&' instructs the Windows operating system to execute another program.Example 6The following code is from an administrative web application designed to allow users to kick off a backup of an Oracle database using a batch-file wrapper around the rman utility and then run a cleanup.bat script to delete some temporary files. The script rmanDB.bat accepts a single command line parameter, which specifies what type of backup to perform. Because access to the database is restricted, the application runs the backup as a privileged user.(bad code)Example Language:Java...String btype = request.getParameter(\\\"backuptype\\\");String cmd = new String(\\\"cmd.exe /K \\\\\\\"c:\\\\\\\\util\\\\\\\\rmanDB.bat \\\"+btype+\\\"&&c:\\\\\\\\utl\\\\\\\\cleanup.bat\\\\\\\"\\\")System.Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd);...The problem here is that the program does not do any validation on the backuptype parameter read from the user. Typically the Runtime.exec() function will not execute multiple commands, but in this case the program first runs the cmd.exe shell in order to run multiple commands with a single call to Runtime.exec(). Once the shell is invoked, it will happily execute multiple commands separated by two ampersands. If an attacker passes a string of the form \\\"& del c:\\\\\\\\dbms\\\\\\\\*.*\\\", then the application will execute this command along with the others specified by the program. Because of the nature of the application, it runs with the privileges necessary to interact with the database, which means whatever command the attacker injects will run with those privileges as well.\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2020-10987OS command injection in Wi-Fi router, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.CVE-2020-10221Template functionality in network configuration management tool allows OS command injection, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.CVE-2020-9054Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) in username parameter, leading to OS command injection (CWE-78), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.CVE-1999-0067Canonical example of OS command injection.

OperationStrategy:  Sandbox or JailRun the code in a \\\"jail\\\" or similar sandbox environment that enforces strict boundaries between the process and the operating system. This may effectively restrict which files can be accessed in a particular directory or which commands can be executed by the software.OS-level examples include the Unix chroot jail, AppArmor, and SELinux. In general, managed code may provide some protection. For example, java.io.FilePermission in the Java SecurityManager allows the software to specify restrictions on file operations.This may not be a feasible solution, and it only limits the impact to the operating system; the rest of the application may still be subject to compromise.Be careful to avoidCWE-243and other weaknesses related to jails.Effectiveness: LimitedNote:The effectiveness of this mitigation depends on the prevention capabilities of the specific sandbox or jail being used and might only help to reduce the scope of an attack, such as restricting the attacker to certain system calls or limiting the portion of the file system that can be accessed.\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignStrategy:  Attack Surface ReductionFor any data that will be used to generate a command to be executed, keep as much of that data out of external control as possible. For example, in web applications, this may require storing the data locally in the session's state instead of sending it out to the client in a hidden form field.\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignFor any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoidCWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignStrategy:  Libraries or FrameworksUse a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.For example, consider using the ESAPI Encoding control [REF-45] or a similar tool, library, or framework. These will help the programmer encode outputs in a manner less prone to error.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Output EncodingWhile it is risky to use dynamically-generated query strings, code, or commands that mix control and data together, sometimes it may be unavoidable. Properly quote arguments and escape any special characters within those arguments. The most conservative approach is to escape or filter all characters that do not pass an extremely strict allowlist (such as everything that is not alphanumeric or white space). If some special characters are still needed, such as white space, wrap each argument in quotes after the escaping/filtering step. Be careful of argument injection (CWE-88).\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationIf the program to be executed allows arguments to be specified within an input file or from standard input, then consider using that mode to pass arguments instead of the command line.\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignStrategy:  ParameterizationIf available, use structured mechanisms that automatically enforce the separation between data and code. These mechanisms may be able to provide the relevant quoting, encoding, and validation automatically, instead of relying on the developer to provide this capability at every point where output is generated.Some languages offer multiple functions that can be used to invoke commands. Where possible, identify any function that invokes a command shell using a single string, and replace it with a function that requires individual arguments. These functions typically perform appropriate quoting and filtering of arguments. For example, in C, the system() function accepts a string that contains the entire command to be executed, whereas execl(), execve(), and others require an array of strings, one for each argument. In Windows, CreateProcess() only accepts one command at a time. In Perl, if system() is provided with an array of arguments, then it will quote each of the arguments.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Input ValidationAssume all input is malicious. Use an \\\"accept known good\\\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \\\"boat\\\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \\\"red\\\" or \\\"blue.\\\"Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.When constructing OS command strings, use stringent allowlists that limit the character set based on the expected value of the parameter in the request. This will indirectly limit the scope of an attack, but this technique is less important than proper output encoding and escaping.Note that proper output encoding, escaping, and quoting is the most effective solution for preventing OS command injection, although input validation may provide some defense-in-depth. This is because it effectively limits what will appear in output. Input validation will not always prevent OS command injection, especially if you are required to support free-form text fields that could contain arbitrary characters. For example, when invoking a mail program, you might need to allow the subject field to contain otherwise-dangerous inputs like \\\";\\\" and \\\">\\\" characters, which would need to be escaped or otherwise handled. In this case, stripping the character might reduce the risk of OS command injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the subject field would not be recorded as the user intended. This might seem to be a minor inconvenience, but it could be more important when the program relies on well-structured subject lines in order to pass messages to other components.Even if you make a mistake in your validation (such as forgetting one out of 100 input fields), appropriate encoding is still likely to protect you from injection-based attacks. As long as it is not done in isolation, input validation is still a useful technique, since it may significantly reduce your attack surface, allow you to detect some attacks, and provide other security benefits that proper encoding does not address.\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignStrategy:  Enforcement by ConversionWhen the set of acceptable objects, such as filenames or URLs, is limited or known, create a mapping from a set of fixed input values (such as numeric IDs) to the actual filenames or URLs, and reject all other inputs.\\n\\nPhase:  OperationStrategy:  Compilation or Build HardeningRun the code in an environment that performs automatic taint propagation and prevents any command execution that uses tainted variables, such as Perl's \\\"-T\\\" switch. This will force the program to perform validation steps that remove the taint, although you must be careful to correctly validate your inputs so that you do not accidentally mark dangerous inputs as untainted (seeCWE-183andCWE-184).\\n\\nPhase:  OperationStrategy:  Environment HardeningRun the code in an environment that performs automatic taint propagation and prevents any command execution that uses tainted variables, such as Perl's \\\"-T\\\" switch. This will force the program to perform validation steps that remove the taint, although you must be careful to correctly validate your inputs so that you do not accidentally mark dangerous inputs as untainted (seeCWE-183andCWE-184).\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationEnsure that error messages only contain minimal details that are useful to the intended audience and no one else. The messages need to strike the balance between being too cryptic (which can confuse users) or being too detailed (which may reveal more than intended). The messages should not reveal the methods that were used to determine the error. Attackers can use detailed information to refine or optimize their original attack, thereby increasing their chances of success.If errors must be captured in some detail, record them in log messages, but consider what could occur if the log messages can be viewed by attackers. Highly sensitive information such as passwords should never be saved to log files.Avoid inconsistent messaging that might accidentally tip off an attacker about internal state, such as whether a user account exists or not.In the context of OS Command Injection, error information passed back to the user might reveal whether an OS command is being executed and possibly which command is being used.\\n\\nPhase:  OperationStrategy:  Sandbox or JailUse runtime policy enforcement to create an allowlist of allowable commands, then prevent use of any command that does not appear in the allowlist. Technologies such as AppArmor are available to do this.\\n\\nPhase:  OperationStrategy:  FirewallUse an application firewall that can detect attacks against this weakness. It can be beneficial in cases in which the code cannot be fixed (because it is controlled by a third party), as an emergency prevention measure while more comprehensive software assurance measures are applied, or to provide defense in depth.Effectiveness: ModerateNote:An application firewall might not cover all possible input vectors. In addition, attack techniques might be available to bypass the protection mechanism, such as using malformed inputs that can still be processed by the component that receives those inputs. Depending on functionality, an application firewall might inadvertently reject or modify legitimate requests. Finally, some manual effort may be required for customization.\\n\\nPhases:  Architecture and Design; OperationStrategy:  Environment HardeningRun your code using the lowest privileges that are required to accomplish the necessary tasks [REF-76]. If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a single task. That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.\\n\\nPhases:  Operation; ImplementationStrategy:  Environment HardeningWhen using PHP, configure the application so that it does not use register_globals. During implementation, develop the application so that it does not rely on this feature, but be wary of implementing a register_globals emulation that is subject to weaknesses such asCWE-95,CWE-621, and similar issues.\",\n    \"Weakness Ordinalities\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Detection Methods\": \"Automated Static AnalysisThis weakness can often be detected using automated static analysis tools. Many modern tools use data flow analysis or constraint-based techniques to minimize the number of false positives.Automated static analysis might not be able to recognize when proper input validation is being performed, leading to false positives - i.e., warnings that do not have any security consequences or require any code changes.Automated static analysis might not be able to detect the usage of custom API functions or third-party libraries that indirectly invoke OS commands, leading to false negatives - especially if the API/library code is not available for analysis.Note:This is not a perfect solution, since 100% accuracy and coverage are not feasible.Automated Dynamic AnalysisThis weakness can be detected using dynamic tools and techniques that interact with the product using large test suites with many diverse inputs, such as fuzz testing (fuzzing), robustness testing, and fault injection. The product's operation may slow down, but it should not become unstable, crash, or generate incorrect results.Effectiveness: ModerateManual Static AnalysisSince this weakness does not typically appear frequently within a single software package, manual white box techniques may be able to provide sufficient code coverage and reduction of false positives if all potentially-vulnerable operations can be assessed within limited time constraints.Effectiveness: HighAutomated Static Analysis - Binary or BytecodeAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Highly cost effective:Bytecode Weakness Analysis - including disassembler + source code weakness analysisBinary Weakness Analysis - including disassembler + source code weakness analysisEffectiveness: HighDynamic Analysis with Automated Results InterpretationAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Cost effective for partial coverage:Web Application ScannerWeb Services ScannerDatabase ScannersEffectiveness: SOAR PartialDynamic Analysis with Manual Results InterpretationAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Cost effective for partial coverage:Fuzz TesterFramework-based FuzzerEffectiveness: SOAR PartialManual Static Analysis - Source CodeAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Highly cost effective:Manual Source Code Review (not inspections)Cost effective for partial coverage:Focused Manual Spotcheck - Focused manual analysis of sourceEffectiveness: HighAutomated Static Analysis - Source CodeAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Highly cost effective:Source code Weakness AnalyzerContext-configured Source Code Weakness AnalyzerEffectiveness: HighArchitecture or Design ReviewAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Highly cost effective:Formal Methods / Correct-By-ConstructionCost effective for partial coverage:Inspection (IEEE 1028 standard) (can apply to requirements, design, source code, etc.)Effectiveness: High\",\n    \"Functional Areas\": \"Program Invocation\",\n    \"Affected Resources\": \"System Process\",\n    \"Memberships\": \"NatureTypeIDNameMemberOf635Weaknesses Originally Used by NVD from 2008 to 2016MemberOf714OWASP Top Ten 2007 Category A3 - Malicious File ExecutionMemberOf727OWASP Top Ten 2004 Category A6 - Injection FlawsMemberOf741CERT C Secure Coding Standard (2008) Chapter 8 - Characters and Strings (STR)MemberOf744CERT C Secure Coding Standard (2008) Chapter 11 - Environment (ENV)MemberOf7512009 Top 25 - Insecure Interaction Between ComponentsMemberOf8012010 Top 25 - Insecure Interaction Between ComponentsMemberOf810OWASP Top Ten 2010 Category A1 - InjectionMemberOf845The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011) Chapter 2 - Input Validation and Data Sanitization (IDS)MemberOf8642011 Top 25 - Insecure Interaction Between ComponentsMemberOf875CERT C++ Secure Coding Section 07 - Characters and Strings (STR)MemberOf878CERT C++ Secure Coding Section 10 - Environment (ENV)MemberOf884CWE Cross-sectionMemberOf929OWASP Top Ten 2013 Category A1 - InjectionMemberOf990SFP Secondary Cluster: Tainted Input to CommandMemberOf1027OWASP Top Ten 2017 Category A1 - InjectionMemberOf1131CISQ Quality Measures (2016) - SecurityMemberOf1134SEI CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java - Guidelines 00.

For some people, it only refers to cases in which the attacker injects command separators into arguments for an application-controlled program that is being invoked. For some people, it refers to any type of attack that can allow the attacker to execute OS commands of their own choosing. This usage could include untrusted search path weaknesses (CWE-426) that cause the application to find and execute an attacker-controlled program. Further complicating the issue is the case when argument injection (CWE-88) allows alternate command-line switches or options to be inserted into the command line, such as an \\\"-exec\\\" switch whose purpose may be to execute the subsequent argument as a command (this -exec switch exists in the UNIX \\\"find\\\" command, for example). In this latter case, however,CWE-88could be regarded as the primary weakness in a chain withCWE-78.Research GapMore investigation is needed into the distinction between the OS command injection variants, including the role with argument injection (CWE-88).

However, numHeaders is defined as a signed int, so it could be negative. If the incoming packet specifies a value such as -3, then the malloc calculation will generate a negative number (say, -300 if each header can be a maximum of 100 bytes). When this result is provided to malloc(), it is first converted to a size_t type. This conversion then produces a large value such as 4294966996, which may cause malloc() to fail or to allocate an extremely large amount of memory (CWE-195). With the appropriate negative numbers, an attacker could trick malloc() into using a very small positive number, which then allocates a buffer that is much smaller than expected, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.Example 2The following code reads a maximum size and performs validation on that size. It then performs a strncpy, assuming it will not exceed the boundaries of the array.

The method receives as arguments the product ID and the integer amount sold. The product ID is used to retrieve the total product count from an inventory object which returns the count as an integer.

Use an appropriate combination of denylists and allowlists to ensure only valid, expected and appropriate input is processed by the system.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Input ValidationAssume all input is malicious. Use an \\\"accept known good\\\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \\\"boat\\\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \\\"red\\\" or \\\"blue.\\\"Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Output EncodingWhile it is risky to use dynamically-generated query strings, code, or commands that mix control and data together, sometimes it may be unavoidable. Properly quote arguments and escape any special characters within those arguments. The most conservative approach is to escape or filter all characters that do not pass an extremely strict allowlist (such as everything that is not alphanumeric or white space). If some special characters are still needed, such as white space, wrap each argument in quotes after the escaping/filtering step. Be careful of argument injection (CWE-88).\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Input ValidationInputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180). Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice (CWE-174).

In this design, authentication involves accepting an incoming password, computing its hash, and comparing it to the stored hash.\\n\\nMany hash algorithms are designed to execute quickly with minimal overhead, even cryptographic hashes. However, this efficiency is a problem for password storage, because it can reduce an attacker's workload for brute-force password cracking. If an attacker can obtain the hashes through some other method (such as SQL injection on a database that stores hashes), then the attacker can store the hashes offline and use various techniques to crack the passwords by computing hashes efficiently. Without a built-in workload, modern attacks can compute large numbers of hashes, or even exhaust the entire space of all possible passwords, within a very short amount of time, using massively-parallel computing (such as cloud computing) and GPU, ASIC, or FPGA hardware. In such a scenario, an efficient hash algorithm helps the attacker.\\n\\nThere are several properties of a hash scheme that are relevant to its strength against an offline, massively-parallel attack:\\n\\nNote that the security requirements for the product may vary depending on the environment and the value of the passwords. Different schemes might not provide all of these properties, yet may still provide sufficient security for the environment.

Some hash functions perform salting automatically. These functions can significantly increase the overhead for a brute force attack compared to intentionally-fast functions such as MD5. For example, rainbow table attacks can become infeasible due to the high computing overhead. Finally, since computing power gets faster and cheaper over time, the technique can be reconfigured to increase the workload without forcing an entire replacement of the algorithm in use.Some hash functions that have one or more of these desired properties include bcrypt [REF-291], scrypt [REF-292], and PBKDF2 [REF-293]. While there is active debate about which of these is the most effective, they are all stronger than using salts with hash functions with very little computing overhead.Note that using these functions can have an impact on performance, so they require special consideration to avoid denial-of-service attacks. However, their configurability provides finer control over how much CPU and memory is used, so it could be adjusted to suit the environment's needs.Effectiveness: High\\n\\nPhases:  Implementation; Architecture and DesignWhen using industry-approved techniques, use them correctly.

It performs authentication by checking if a cookie has been set.(bad code)Example Language:PHP$auth = $_COOKIES['authenticated'];if (! $auth) {if (AuthenticateUser($_POST['user'], $_POST['password']) == \\\"success\\\") {// save the cookie to send out in future responsessetcookie(\\\"authenticated\\\", \\\"1\\\", time()+60*60*2);}else {ShowLoginScreen();die(\\\"\\\\n\\\");}}DisplayMedicalHistory($_POST['patient_ID']);The programmer expects that the AuthenticateUser() check will always be applied, and the \\\"authenticated\\\" cookie will only be set when authentication succeeds. The programmer even diligently specifies a 2-hour expiration for the cookie.However, the attacker can set the \\\"authenticated\\\" cookie to a non-zero value such as 1. As a result, the $auth variable is 1, and the AuthenticateUser() check is not even performed. The attacker has bypassed the authentication.Example 3In the following example, an authentication flag is read from a browser cookie, thus allowing for external control of user state data.(bad code)Example Language:JavaCookie[] cookies = request.getCookies();for (int i =0; i< cookies.length; i++) {Cookie c = cookies[i];if (c.getName().equals(\\\"authenticated\\\") && Boolean.TRUE.equals(c.getValue())) {authenticated = true;}}Example 4The following code samples use a DNS lookup in order to decide whether or not an inbound request is from a trusted host. If an attacker can poison the DNS cache, they can gain trusted status.(bad code)Example Language:Cstruct hostent *hp;struct in_addr myaddr;char* tHost = \\\"trustme.example.com\\\";myaddr.s_addr=inet_addr(ip_addr_string);hp = gethostbyaddr((char *) &myaddr, sizeof(struct in_addr), AF_INET);if (hp && !strncmp(hp->h_name, tHost, sizeof(tHost))) {trusted = true;} else {trusted = false;}(bad code)Example Language:JavaString ip = request.getRemoteAddr();InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getByName(ip);if (addr.getCanonicalHostName().endsWith(\\\"trustme.com\\\")) {trusted = true;}(bad code)Example Language:C#IPAddress hostIPAddress = IPAddress.Parse(RemoteIpAddress);IPHostEntry hostInfo = Dns.GetHostByAddress(hostIPAddress);if (hostInfo.HostName.EndsWith(\\\"trustme.com\\\")) {trusted = true;}IP addresses are more reliable than DNS names, but they can also be spoofed. Attackers can easily forge the source IP address of the packets they send, but response packets will return to the forged IP address. To see the response packets, the attacker has to sniff the traffic between the victim machine and the forged IP address. In order to accomplish the required sniffing, attackers typically attempt to locate themselves on the same subnet as the victim machine. Attackers may be able to circumvent this requirement by using source routing, but source routing is disabled across much of the Internet today. In summary, IP address verification can be a useful part of an authentication scheme, but it should not be the single factor required for authentication.\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2009-1549Attacker can bypass authentication by setting a cookie to a specific value.CVE-2009-1619Attacker can bypass authentication and gain admin privileges by setting an \\\"admin\\\" cookie to 1.CVE-2009-0864Content management system allows admin privileges by setting a \\\"login\\\" cookie to \\\"OK.\\\"CVE-2008-5784e-dating application allows admin privileges by setting the admin cookie to 1.CVE-2008-6291Web-based email list manager allows attackers to gain admin privileges by setting a login cookie to \\\"admin.\\\"\",\n    \"References\": \"[REF-754] Frank Kim. \\\"Top 25 Series - Rank 6 - Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\\\".

Do not allow any application user to affect state directly in any way other than through legitimate actions leading to state transitions.If information must be stored on the client, do not do so without encryption and integrity checking, or otherwise having a mechanism on the server side to catch tampering. Use a message authentication code (MAC) algorithm, such as Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC) [REF-529]. Apply this against the state or sensitive data that has to be exposed, which can guarantee the integrity of the data - i.e., that the data has not been modified. Ensure that a strong hash function is used (CWE-328).\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignStrategy:  Libraries or FrameworksUse a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.With a stateless protocol such as HTTP, use a framework that maintains the state for you.Examples include ASP.NET View State [REF-756] and the OWASP ESAPI Session Management feature [REF-45].Be careful of language features that provide state support, since these might be provided as a convenience to the programmer and may not be considering security.\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignFor any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoidCWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.\\n\\nPhases:  Operation; ImplementationStrategy:  Environment HardeningWhen using PHP, configure the application so that it does not use register_globals. During implementation, develop the application so that it does not rely on this feature, but be wary of implementing a register_globals emulation that is subject to weaknesses such asCWE-95,CWE-621, and similar issues.\\n\\nPhases:  Architecture and Design; ImplementationStrategy:  Attack Surface ReductionUnderstand all the potential areas where untrusted inputs can enter your software: parameters or arguments, cookies, anything read from the network, environment variables, reverse DNS lookups, query results, request headers, URL components, e-mail, files, filenames, databases, and any external systems that provide data to the application. Remember that such inputs may be obtained indirectly through API calls.Identify all inputs that are used for security decisions and determine if you can modify the design so that you do not have to rely on submitted inputs at all.

This allows anyone who can control the system property to determine what file is used. Ideally, the path should be resolved relative to some kind of application or user home directory.Example 2This script intends to read a user-supplied file from the current directory. The user inputs the relative path to the file and the script uses Python's os.path.join() function to combine the path to the current working directory with the provided path to the specified file. This results in an absolute path to the desired file. If the file does not exist when the script attempts to read it, an error is printed to the user.(bad code)Example Language:Pythonimport osimport sysdef main():filename = sys.argv[1]path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), filename)try:with open(path, 'r') as f:file_data = f.read()except FileNotFoundError as e:print(\\\"Error - file not found\\\")main()However, if the user supplies an absolute path, the os.path.join() function will discard the path to the current working directory and use only the absolute path provided. For example, if the current working directory is /home/user/documents, but the user inputs /etc/passwd, os.path.join() will use only /etc/passwd, as it is considered an absolute path. In the above scenario, this would cause the script to access and read the /etc/passwd file.(good code)Example Language:Pythonimport osimport sysdef main():filename = sys.argv[1]path = os.path.normpath(f\\\"{os.getcwd()}{os.sep}{filename}\\\")try:with open(path, 'r') as f:file_data = f.read()except FileNotFoundError as e:print(\\\"Error - file not found\\\")main()The constructed path string uses os.sep to add the appropriate separation character for the given operating system (e.g. '\\\\' or '/') and the call to os.path.normpath() removes any additional slashes that may have been entered - this may occur particularly when using a Windows path. By putting the pieces of the path string together in this fashion, the script avoids a call to os.path.join() and any potential issues that might arise if an absolute path is entered. With this version of the script, if the current working directory is /home/user/documents, and the user inputs /etc/passwd, the resulting path will be /home/user/documents/etc/passwd. The user is therefore contained within the current working directory as intended.\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2022-31503Python package constructs filenames using an unsafe os.path.join call on untrusted input, allowing absolute path traversal because os.path.join resets the pathname to an absolute path that is specified as part of the input.CVE-2002-1345Multiple FTP clients write arbitrary files via absolute paths in server responsesCVE-2001-1269ZIP file extractor allows full pathCVE-2002-1818Path traversal using absolute pathnameCVE-2002-1913Path traversal using absolute pathnameCVE-2005-2147Path traversal using absolute pathnameCVE-2000-0614Arbitrary files may be overwritten via compressed attachments that specify absolute path names for the decompressed output.CVE-1999-1263Mail client allows remote attackers to overwrite arbitrary files via an e-mail message containing a uuencoded attachment that specifies the full pathname for the file to be modified.CVE-2003-0753Remote attackers can read arbitrary files via a full pathname to the target file in config parameter.CVE-2002-1525Remote attackers can read arbitrary files via an absolute pathname.CVE-2001-0038Remote attackers can read arbitrary files by specifying the drive letter in the requested URL.CVE-2001-0255FTP server allows remote attackers to list arbitrary directories by using the \\\"ls\\\" command and including the drive letter name (e.g. C:) in the requested pathname.CVE-2001-0933FTP server allows remote attackers to list the contents of arbitrary drives via a ls command that includes the drive letter as an argument.CVE-2002-0466Server allows remote attackers to browse arbitrary directories via a full pathname in the arguments to certain dynamic pages.CVE-2002-1483Remote attackers can read arbitrary files via an HTTP request whose argument is a filename of the form \\\"C:\\\" (Drive letter), \\\"//absolute/path\\\", or \\\"..\\\" .CVE-2004-2488FTP server read/access arbitrary files using \\\"C:\\\\\\\" filenamesCVE-2001-0687FTP server allows a remote attacker to retrieve privileged web server system information by specifying arbitrary paths in the UNC format (\\\\\\\\computername\\\\sharename).\",\n    \"References\": \"[REF-62] Mark Dowd, John McDonald\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand Justin Schuh. \\\"The Art of Software Security Assessment\\\".

When a signal handler uses global or static variables, or invokes functions that ultimately depend on such state or its associated metadata, then it could corrupt system state that is being used by normal functionality. This could subject the program to race conditions or other weaknesses that allow an attacker to cause the program state to be corrupted. While denial of service is frequently the consequence, in some cases this weakness could be leveraged for code execution.\\n\\nThere are several different scenarios that introduce this issue:\\n\\nNote that in some environments or contexts, it might be possible for the signal handler to be interrupted itself.\\n\\nIf both a signal handler and the normal behavior of the product have to operate on the same set of state variables, and a signal is received in the middle of the normal execution's modifications of those variables, the variables may be in an incorrect or corrupt state during signal handler execution, and possibly still incorrect or corrupt upon return.\",\n    \"Alternate Terms\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Relationships\": \"Relevant to the view \\\"Research Concepts\\\" (CWE-1000)NatureTypeIDNameChildOf364Signal Handler Race ConditionParentOf479Signal Handler Use of a Non-reentrant Function\",\n    \"Modes of Introduction\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Applicable Platforms\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Common Consequences\": \"ScopeImpactLikelihood\\n\\nIntegrityConfidentialityAvailabilityTechnical Impact:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart; Execute Unauthorized Code or CommandsThe most common consequence will be a corruption of the state of the product, possibly leading to a crash or exit. However, if the signal handler is operating on state variables for security relevant libraries or protection mechanisms, the consequences can be far more severe, including protection mechanism bypass, privilege escalation, or information exposure.\",\n    \"Likelihood of Exploit\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Demonstrative Examples\": \"Example 1This code registers the same signal handler function with two different signals (CWE-831). If those signals are sent to the process, the handler creates a log message (specified in the first argument to the program) and exits.(bad code)Example Language:Cchar *logMessage;void handler (int sigNum) {syslog(LOG_NOTICE, \\\"%s\\\\n\\\", logMessage);free(logMessage);/* artificially increase the size of the timing window to make demonstration of this weakness easier. */sleep(10);exit(0);}int main (int argc, char* argv[]) {logMessage = strdup(argv[1]);/* Register signal handlers. */signal(SIGHUP, handler);signal(SIGTERM, handler);/* artificially increase the size of the timing window to make demonstration of this weakness easier. */sleep(10);}The handler function uses global state (globalVar and logMessage), and it can be called by both the SIGHUP and SIGTERM signals. An attack scenario might follow these lines:The program begins execution, initializes logMessage, and registers the signal handlers for SIGHUP and SIGTERM.The program begins its \\\"normal\\\" functionality, which is simplified as sleep(), but could be any functionality that consumes some time.The attacker sends SIGHUP, which invokes handler (call this \\\"SIGHUP-handler\\\").SIGHUP-handler begins to execute, calling syslog().syslog() calls malloc(), which is non-reentrant. malloc() begins to modify metadata to manage the heap.The attacker then sends SIGTERM.SIGHUP-handler is interrupted, but syslog's malloc call is still executing and has not finished modifying its metadata.The SIGTERM handler is invoked.SIGTERM-handler records the log message using syslog(), then frees the logMessage variable.At this point, the state of the heap is uncertain, because malloc is still modifying the metadata for the heap; the metadata might be in an inconsistent state. The SIGTERM-handler call to free() is assuming that the metadata is inconsistent, possibly causing it to write data to the wrong location while managing the heap. The result is memory corruption, which could lead to a crash or even code execution, depending on the circumstances under which the code is running.Note that this is an adaptation of a classic example as originally presented by Michal Zalewski [REF-360]; the original example was shown to be exploitable for code execution.Also note that the strdup(argv[1]) call contains a potential buffer over-read (CWE-126) if the program is called without any arguments, because argc would be 0, and argv[1] would point outside the bounds of the array.Example 2The following code registers a signal handler with multiple signals in order to log when a specific event occurs and to free associated memory before exiting.(bad code)Example Language:C#include <signal.h>#include <syslog.h>#include <string.h>#include <stdlib.h>void *global1, *global2;char *what;void sh (int dummy) {syslog(LOG_NOTICE,\\\"%s\\\\n\\\",what);free(global2);free(global1);/* Sleep statements added to expand timing window for race condition */sleep(10);exit(0);}int main (int argc,char* argv[]) {what=argv[1];global1=strdup(argv[2]);global2=malloc(340);signal(SIGHUP,sh);signal(SIGTERM,sh);/* Sleep statements added to expand timing window for race condition */sleep(10);exit(0);}However, the following sequence of events may result in a double-free (CWE-415):a SIGHUP is delivered to the processsh() is invoked to process the SIGHUPThis first invocation of sh() reaches the point where global1 is freedAt this point, a SIGTERM is sent to the processthe second invocation of sh() might do another free of global1this results in a double-free (CWE-415)This is just one possible exploitation of the above code. As another example, the syslog call may use malloc calls which are not async-signal safe. This could cause corruption of the heap management structures.

Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:\\n\\nIn the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.\\n\\nThe Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.\",\n    \"Alternate Terms\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Relationships\": \"Relevant to the view \\\"Research Concepts\\\" (CWE-1000)NatureTypeIDNameChildOf798Use of Hard-coded CredentialsPeerOf321Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic KeyPeerOf257Storing Passwords in a Recoverable FormatCanFollow656Reliance on Security Through ObscurityRelevant to the view \\\"Architectural Concepts\\\" (CWE-1008)NatureTypeIDNameMemberOf1010Authenticate ActorsRelevant to the view \\\"CISQ Quality Measures (2020)\\\" (CWE-1305)NatureTypeIDNameChildOf798Use of Hard-coded CredentialsRelevant to the view \\\"CISQ Data Protection Measures\\\" (CWE-1340)NatureTypeIDNameChildOf798Use of Hard-coded Credentials\",\n    \"Modes of Introduction\": \"PhaseNote\\n\\nImplementationREALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.\\n\\nArchitecture and Design\",\n    \"Applicable Platforms\": \"Languages\\n\\nClass: Not Language-Specific(Undetermined Prevalence)\\n\\nTechnologies\\n\\nClass: ICS/OT(Undetermined Prevalence)\",\n    \"Common Consequences\": \"ScopeImpactLikelihood\\n\\nAccess ControlTechnical Impact:Gain Privileges or Assume IdentityIf hard-coded passwords are used, it is almost certain that malicious users will gain access through the account in question.\",\n    \"Likelihood of Exploit\": \"High\",\n    \"Demonstrative Examples\": \"Example 1The following code uses a hard-coded password to connect to a database:(bad code)Example Language:Java...DriverManager.getConnection(url, \\\"scott\\\", \\\"tiger\\\");...This is an example of an external hard-coded password on the client-side of a connection.

Once the program has shipped, there is no going back from the database user \\\"scott\\\" with a password of \\\"tiger\\\" unless the program is patched. A devious employee with access to this information can use it to break into the system. Even worse, if attackers have access to the bytecode for application, they can use the javap -c command to access the disassembled code, which will contain the values of the passwords used. The result of this operation might look something like the following for the example above:(attack code)javap -c ConnMngr.class22: ldc #36; //String jdbc:mysql://ixne.com/rxsql24: ldc #38; //String scott26: ldc #17; //String tigerExample 2The following code is an example of an internal hard-coded password in the back-end:(bad code)Example Language:Cint VerifyAdmin(char *password) {if (strcmp(password, \\\"Mew!\\\")) {printf(\\\"Incorrect Password!\\\\n\\\");return(0)}printf(\\\"Entering Diagnostic Mode...\\\\n\\\");return(1);}(bad code)Example Language:Javaint VerifyAdmin(String password) {if (!password.equals(\\\"Mew!\\\")) {return(0)}//Diagnostic Modereturn(1);}Every instance of this program can be placed into diagnostic mode with the same password.

The researchers reported 56 vulnerabilities and said that the products were \\\"insecure by design\\\" [REF-1283]. If exploited, these vulnerabilities often allowed adversaries to change how the products operated, ranging from denial of service to changing the code that the products executed.

Properly protect the key (CWE-320). If you cannot use encryption to protect the file, then make sure that the permissions are as restrictive as possible.\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignFor inbound authentication: Rather than hard-code a default username and password for first time logins, utilize a \\\"first login\\\" mode that requires the user to enter a unique strong password.\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignPerform access control checks and limit which entities can access the feature that requires the hard-coded password. For example, a feature might only be enabled through the system console instead of through a network connection.\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignFor inbound authentication: apply strong one-way hashes to your passwords and store those hashes in a configuration file or database with appropriate access control. That way, theft of the file/database still requires the attacker to try to crack the password. When receiving an incoming password during authentication, take the hash of the password and compare it to the hash that you have saved.Use randomly assigned salts for each separate hash that you generate. This increases the amount of computation that an attacker needs to conduct a brute-force attack, possibly limiting the effectiveness of the rainbow table method.\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignFor front-end to back-end connections: Three solutions are possible, although none are complete.The first suggestion involves the use of generated passwords which are changed automatically and must be entered at given time intervals by a system administrator. These passwords will be held in memory and only be valid for the time intervals.Next, the passwords used should be limited at the back end to only performing actions valid for the front end, as opposed to having full access.Finally, the messages sent should be tagged and checksummed with time sensitive values so as to prevent replay style attacks.\",\n    \"Weakness Ordinalities\": \"OrdinalityDescriptionPrimary(where the weakness exists independent of other weaknesses)\",\n    \"Detection Methods\": \"Manual AnalysisThis weakness can be detected using tools and techniques that require manual (human) analysis, such as penetration testing, threat modeling, and interactive tools that allow the tester to record and modify an active session.Note:These may be more effective than strictly automated techniques. This is especially the case with weaknesses that are related to design and business rules.Black BoxUse monitoring tools that examine the software's process as it interacts with the operating system and the network. This technique is useful in cases when source code is unavailable, if the software was not developed by you, or if you want to verify that the build phase did not introduce any new weaknesses. Examples include debuggers that directly attach to the running process; system-call tracing utilities such as truss (Solaris) and strace (Linux); system activity monitors such as FileMon, RegMon, Process Monitor, and other Sysinternals utilities (Windows); and sniffers and protocol analyzers that monitor network traffic.Attach the monitor to the process and perform a login. Using disassembled code, look at the associated instructions and see if any of them appear to be comparing the input to a fixed string or value.Automated Static AnalysisAutomated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect \\\"sources\\\" (origins of input) with \\\"sinks\\\" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)Effectiveness: High\",\n    \"Functional Areas\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Affected Resources\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Memberships\": \"NatureTypeIDNameMemberOf2547PK - Security FeaturesMemberOf724OWASP Top Ten 2004 Category A3 - Broken Authentication and Session ManagementMemberOf7532009 Top 25 - Porous DefensesMemberOf861The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011) Chapter 18 - Miscellaneous (MSC)MemberOf950SFP Secondary Cluster: Hardcoded Sensitive DataMemberOf1152SEI CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java - Guidelines 49.

Because forking is a relatively expensive operation, an attacker would be able to cause the system to run out of CPU, processes, or memory by making a large number of connections. Alternatively, an attacker could consume all available connections, preventing others from accessing the system remotely.Example 2In the following example a server socket connection is used to accept a request to store data on the local file system using a specified filename. The method openSocketConnection establishes a server socket to accept requests from a client. When a client establishes a connection to this service the getNextMessage method is first used to retrieve from the socket the name of the file to store the data, the openFileToWrite method will validate the filename and open a file to write to on the local file system. The getNextMessage is then used within a while loop to continuously read data from the socket and output the data to the file until there is no longer any data from the socket.(bad code)Example Language:Cint writeDataFromSocketToFile(char *host, int port){char filename[FILENAME_SIZE];char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];int socket = openSocketConnection(host, port);if (socket < 0) {printf(\\\"Unable to open socket connection\\\");return(FAIL);}if (getNextMessage(socket, filename, FILENAME_SIZE) > 0) {if (openFileToWrite(filename) > 0) {while (getNextMessage(socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE) > 0){if (!(writeToFile(buffer) > 0))break;}}closeFile();}closeSocket(socket);}This example creates a situation where data can be dumped to a file on the local file system without any limits on the size of the file. This could potentially exhaust file or disk resources and/or limit other clients' ability to access the service.Example 3In the following example, the processMessage method receives a two dimensional character array containing the message to be processed. The two-dimensional character array contains the length of the message in the first character array and the message body in the second character array. The getMessageLength method retrieves the integer value of the length from the first character array. After validating that the message length is greater than zero, the body character array pointer points to the start of the second character array of the two-dimensional character array and memory is allocated for the new body character array.(bad code)Example Language:C/* process message accepts a two-dimensional character array of the form [length][body] containing the message to be processed */int processMessage(char **message){char *body;int length = getMessageLength(message[0]);if (length > 0) {body = &message[1][0];processMessageBody(body);return(SUCCESS);}else {printf(\\\"Unable to process message; invalid message length\\\");return(FAIL);}}This example creates a situation where the length of the body character array can be very large and will consume excessive memory, exhausting system resources. This can be avoided by restricting the length of the second character array with a maximum length checkAlso, consider changing the type from 'int' to 'unsigned int', so that you are always guaranteed that the number is positive. This might not be possible if the protocol specifically requires allowing negative values, or if you cannot control the return value from getMessageLength(), but it could simplify the check to ensure the input is positive, and eliminate other errors such as signed-to-unsigned conversion errors (CWE-195) that may occur elsewhere in the code.(good code)Example Language:Cunsigned int length = getMessageLength(message[0]);if ((length > 0) && (length < MAX_LENGTH)) {...}Example 4In the following example, a server object creates a server socket and accepts client connections to the socket. For every client connection to the socket a separate thread object is generated using the ClientSocketThread class that handles request made by the client through the socket.(bad code)Example Language:Javapublic void acceptConnections() {try {ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(SERVER_PORT);int counter = 0;boolean hasConnections = true;while (hasConnections) {Socket client = serverSocket.accept();Thread t = new Thread(new ClientSocketThread(client));t.setName(client.getInetAddress().getHostName() + \\\":\\\" + counter++);t.start();}serverSocket.close();} catch (IOException ex) {...}}In this example there is no limit to the number of client connections and client threads that are created. Allowing an unlimited number of client connections and threads could potentially overwhelm the system and system resources.The server should limit the number of client connections and the client threads that are created. This can be easily done by creating a thread pool object that limits the number of threads that are generated.(good code)Example Language:Javapublic static final int SERVER_PORT = 4444;public static final int MAX_CONNECTIONS = 10;...public void acceptConnections() {try {ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(SERVER_PORT);int counter = 0;boolean hasConnections = true;while (hasConnections) {hasConnections = checkForMoreConnections();Socket client = serverSocket.accept();Thread t = new Thread(new ClientSocketThread(client));t.setName(client.getInetAddress().getHostName() + \\\":\\\" + counter++);ExecutorService pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(MAX_CONNECTIONS);pool.execute(t);}serverSocket.close();} catch (IOException ex) {...}}Example 5An unnamed web site allowed a user to purchase tickets for an event.

Set per-user limits for resources. Allow the system administrator to define these limits. Be careful to avoidCWE-410.\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignDesign throttling mechanisms into the system architecture. The best protection is to limit the amount of resources that an unauthorized user can cause to be expended. A strong authentication and access control model will help prevent such attacks from occurring in the first place, and it will help the administrator to identify who is committing the abuse. The login application should be protected against DoS attacks as much as possible. Limiting the database access, perhaps by caching result sets, can help minimize the resources expended. To further limit the potential for a DoS attack, consider tracking the rate of requests received from users and blocking requests that exceed a defined rate threshold.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Input ValidationAssume all input is malicious. Use an \\\"accept known good\\\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \\\"boat\\\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \\\"red\\\" or \\\"blue.\\\"Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.Note:This will only be applicable to cases where user input can influence the size or frequency of resource allocations.\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignFor any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoidCWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignMitigation of resource exhaustion attacks requires that the target system either:recognizes the attack and denies that user further access for a given amount of time, typically by using increasing time delaysuniformly throttles all requests in order to make it more difficult to consume resources more quickly than they can again be freed.The first of these solutions is an issue in itself though, since it may allow attackers to prevent the use of the system by a particular valid user. If the attacker impersonates the valid user, they may be able to prevent the user from accessing the server in question.The second solution can be difficult to effectively institute -- and even when properly done, it does not provide a full solution. It simply requires more resources on the part of the attacker.\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignEnsure that protocols have specific limits of scale placed on them.\\n\\nPhases:  Architecture and Design; ImplementationIf the program must fail, ensure that it fails gracefully (fails closed). There may be a temptation to simply let the program fail poorly in cases such as low memory conditions, but an attacker may be able to assert control before the software has fully exited. Alternately, an uncontrolled failure could cause cascading problems with other downstream components; for example, the program could send a signal to a downstream process so the process immediately knows that a problem has occurred and has a better chance of recovery.Ensure that all failures in resource allocation place the system into a safe posture.\\n\\nPhases:  Operation; Architecture and DesignStrategy:  Resource LimitationUse resource-limiting settings provided by the operating system or environment. For example, when managing system resources in POSIX, setrlimit() can be used to set limits for certain types of resources, and getrlimit() can determine how many resources are available. However, these functions are not available on all operating systems.When the current levels get close to the maximum that is defined for the application (seeCWE-770), then limit the allocation of further resources to privileged users; alternately, begin releasing resources for less-privileged users. While this mitigation may protect the system from attack, it will not necessarily stop attackers from adversely impacting other users.Ensure that the application performs the appropriate error checks and error handling in case resources become unavailable (CWE-703).\",\n    \"Weakness Ordinalities\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Detection Methods\": \"Manual Static AnalysisManual static analysis can be useful for finding this weakness, but it might not achieve desired code coverage within limited time constraints. If denial-of-service is not considered a significant risk, or if there is strong emphasis on consequences such as code execution, then manual analysis may not focus on this weakness at all.FuzzingWhile fuzzing is typically geared toward finding low-level implementation bugs, it can inadvertently find uncontrolled resource allocation problems. This can occur when the fuzzer generates a large number of test cases but does not restart the targeted product in between test cases. If an individual test case produces a crash, but it does not do so reliably, then an inability to limit resource allocation may be the cause.When the allocation is directly affected by numeric inputs, then fuzzing may produce indications of this weakness.Effectiveness: OpportunisticAutomated Dynamic AnalysisCertain automated dynamic analysis techniques may be effective in producing side effects of uncontrolled resource allocation problems, especially with resources such as processes, memory, and connections. The technique may involve generating a large number of requests to the product within a short time frame. Manual analysis is likely required to interpret the results.Automated Static AnalysisSpecialized configuration or tuning may be required to train automated tools to recognize this weakness.Automated static analysis typically has limited utility in recognizing unlimited allocation problems, except for the missing release of program-independent system resources such as files, sockets, and processes, or unchecked arguments to memory. For system resources, automated static analysis may be able to detect circumstances in which resources are not released after they have expired, or if too much of a resource is requested at once, as can occur with memory. Automated analysis of configuration files may be able to detect settings that do not specify a maximum value.Automated static analysis tools will not be appropriate for detecting exhaustion of custom resources, such as an intended security policy in which a bulletin board user is only allowed to make a limited number of posts per day.\",\n    \"Functional Areas\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Affected Resources\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Memberships\": \"NatureTypeIDNameMemberOf8022010 Top 25 - Risky Resource ManagementMemberOf857The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011) Chapter 14 - Input Output (FIO)MemberOf858The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011) Chapter 15 - Serialization (SER)MemberOf861The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011) Chapter 18 - Miscellaneous (MSC)MemberOf8672011 Top 25 - Weaknesses On the CuspMemberOf876CERT C++ Secure Coding Section 08 - Memory Management (MEM)MemberOf877CERT C++ Secure Coding Section 09 - Input Output (FIO)MemberOf884CWE Cross-sectionMemberOf985SFP Secondary Cluster: Unrestricted ConsumptionMemberOf1147SEI CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java - Guidelines 13.

However, the field is mistakenly set to true during static initialization, so the initialization code is never reached.(bad code)Example Language:Javaprivate boolean initialized = true;public void someMethod() {if (!initialized) {// perform initialization tasks...initialized = true;}Example 2The following code intends to limit certain operations to the administrator only.(bad code)Example Language:Perl$username = GetCurrentUser();$state = GetStateData($username);if (defined($state)) {$uid = ExtractUserID($state);}# do stuffif ($uid == 0) {DoAdminThings();}If the application is unable to extract the state information - say, due to a database timeout - then the $uid variable will not be explicitly set by the programmer. This will cause $uid to be regarded as equivalent to \\\"0\\\" in the conditional, allowing the original user to perform administrator actions. Even if the attacker cannot directly influence the state data, unexpected errors could cause incorrect privileges to be assigned to a user just by accident.Example 3The following code intends to concatenate a string to a variable and print the string.(bad code)Example Language:Cchar str[20];strcat(str, \\\"hello world\\\");printf(\\\"%s\\\", str);This might seem innocent enough, but str was not initialized, so it contains random memory. As a result, str[0] might not contain the null terminator, so the copy might start at an offset other than 0. The consequences can vary, depending on the underlying memory.If a null terminator is found before str[8], then some bytes of random garbage will be printed before the \\\"hello world\\\" string. The memory might contain sensitive information from previous uses, such as a password (which might occur as a result ofCWE-14orCWE-244). In this example, it might not be a big deal, but consider what could happen if large amounts of memory are printed out before the null terminator is found.If a null terminator isn't found before str[8], then a buffer overflow could occur, since strcat will first look for the null terminator, then copy 12 bytes starting with that location. Alternately, a buffer over-read might occur (CWE-126) if a null terminator isn't found before the end of the memory segment is reached, leading to a segmentation fault and crash.Example 4This example will leave test_string in an unknown condition when i is the same value as err_val, because test_string is not initialized (CWE-456). Depending on where this code segment appears (e.g. within a function body), test_string might be random if it is stored on the heap or stack. If the variable is declared in static memory, it might be zero or NULL. Compiler optimization might contribute to the unpredictability of this address.(bad code)Example Language:Cchar *test_string;if (i != err_val){test_string = \\\"Hello World!\\\";}printf(\\\"%s\\\", test_string);When the printf() is reached, test_string might be an unexpected address, so the printf might print junk strings (CWE-457).To fix this code, there are a couple approaches to\\n\\t\\t\\t  making sure that test_string has been properly set once\\n\\t\\t\\t  it reaches the printf().One solution would be to set test_string to an\\n\\t\\t\\t  acceptable default before the conditional:(good code)Example Language:Cchar *test_string = \\\"Done at the beginning\\\";if (i != err_val){test_string = \\\"Hello World!\\\";}printf(\\\"%s\\\", test_string);Another solution is to ensure that each\\n\\t\\t\\t  branch of the conditional - including the default/else\\n\\t\\t\\t  branch - could ensure that test_string is set:(good code)Example Language:Cchar *test_string;if (i != err_val){test_string = \\\"Hello World!\\\";}else {test_string = \\\"Done on the other side!\\\";}printf(\\\"%s\\\", test_string);\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2020-20739A variable that has its value set in a conditional statement is sometimes used when the conditional fails, sometimes causing data leakageCVE-2005-1036Chain: Bypass of access restrictions due to improper authorization (CWE-862) of a user results from an improperly initialized (CWE-909) I/O permission bitmap\",\n    \"References\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Content History\": \"SubmissionsSubmission DateSubmitterOrganization2012-12-21(CWE 2.4, 2013-02-21)CWE Content TeamMITRENew weakness based on discussion on the CWE research list in December 2012.ModificationsModification DateModifierOrganization2019-06-20CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Relationships2020-02-24CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Relationships2021-03-15CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Demonstrative_Examples, Observed_Examples2023-01-31CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Description, Potential_Mitigations, Relationships2023-04-27CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Relationships2023-06-29CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Mapping_Notes2023-10-26CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Mapping_Notes, Type\",\n    \"Previous Entry Names\": \"N/A\"\n}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n    \"Potential Mitigations\": \"Phase:  ImplementationExplicitly initialize the resource before use.

This will almost certainly result in information disclosure, and possibly a buffer overflow condition, which may be exploited to execute arbitrary code.\\n\\nConfidentialityIntegrityAvailabilityTechnical Impact:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart; Read Memory; DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU); DoS: Resource Consumption (Memory)If a null character is omitted from a string, then most string-copying functions will read data until they locate a null character, even outside of the intended boundaries of the string. This could: cause a crash due to a segmentation fault cause sensitive adjacent memory to be copied and sent to an outsider trigger a buffer overflow when the copy is being written to a fixed-size buffer.\\n\\nIntegrityAvailabilityTechnical Impact:Modify Memory; DoS: Crash, Exit, or RestartMisplaced null characters may result in any number of security problems. The biggest issue is a subset of buffer overflow, and write-what-where conditions, where data corruption occurs from the writing of a null character over valid data, or even instructions. A randomly placed null character may put the system into an undefined state, and therefore make it prone to crashing. A misplaced null character may corrupt other data in memory.\\n\\nIntegrityConfidentialityAvailabilityAccess ControlOtherTechnical Impact:Alter Execution Logic; Execute Unauthorized Code or CommandsShould the null character corrupt the process flow, or affect a flag controlling access, it may lead to logical errors which allow for the execution of arbitrary code.\",\n    \"Likelihood of Exploit\": \"Medium\",\n    \"Demonstrative Examples\": \"Example 1The following code reads from cfgfile and copies the input into inputbuf using strcpy(). The code mistakenly assumes that inputbuf will always contain a NULL terminator.(bad code)Example Language:C#define MAXLEN 1024...char *pathbuf[MAXLEN];...read(cfgfile,inputbuf,MAXLEN); //does not null terminatestrcpy(pathbuf,inputbuf); //requires null terminated input...The code above will behave correctly if the data read from cfgfile is null terminated on disk as expected. But if an attacker is able to modify this input so that it does not contain the expected NULL character, the call to strcpy() will continue copying from memory until it encounters an arbitrary NULL character. This will likely overflow the destination buffer and, if the attacker can control the contents of memory immediately following inputbuf, can leave the application susceptible to a buffer overflow attack.Example 2In the following code, readlink() expands the name of a symbolic link stored in pathname and puts the absolute path into buf. The length of the resulting value is then calculated using strlen().(bad code)Example Language:Cchar buf[MAXPATH];...readlink(pathname, buf, MAXPATH);int length = strlen(buf);...The code above will not always behave correctly as readlink() does not append a NULL byte to buf. Readlink() will stop copying characters once the maximum size of buf has been reached to avoid overflowing the buffer, this will leave the value buf not NULL terminated. In this situation, strlen() will continue traversing memory until it encounters an arbitrary NULL character further on down the stack, resulting in a length value that is much larger than the size of string. Readlink() does return the number of bytes copied, but when this return value is the same as stated buf size (in this case MAXPATH), it is impossible to know whether the pathname is precisely that many bytes long, or whether readlink() has truncated the name to avoid overrunning the buffer. In testing, vulnerabilities like this one might not be caught because the unused contents of buf and the memory immediately following it may be NULL, thereby causing strlen() to appear as if it is behaving correctly.Example 3While the following example is not exploitable, it provides a good example of how nulls can be omitted or misplaced, even when \\\"safe\\\" functions are used:(bad code)Example Language:C#include <stdio.h>#include <string.h>int main() {char longString[] = \\\"String signifying nothing\\\";char shortString[16];strncpy(shortString, longString, 16);printf(\\\"The last character in shortString is: %c (%1$x)\\\\n\\\", shortString[15]);return (0);}The above code gives the following output: \\\"The last character in shortString is: n (6e)\\\". So, the shortString array does not end in a NULL character, even though the \\\"safe\\\" string function strncpy() was used. The reason is that strncpy() does not impliciitly add a NULL character at the end of the string when the source is equal in length or longer than the provided size.\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2000-0312Attacker does not null-terminate argv[] when invoking another program.CVE-2003-0777Interrupted step causes resultant lack of null termination.CVE-2004-1072Fault causes resultant lack of null termination, leading to buffer expansion.CVE-2001-1389Multiple vulnerabilities related to improper null termination.CVE-2003-0143Product does not null terminate a message buffer after snprintf-like call, leading to overflow.CVE-2009-2523Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).\",\n    \"References\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Content History\": \"SubmissionsSubmission DateSubmitterOrganization2006-07-19(CWE Draft 3, 2006-07-19)PLOVERModificationsModification DateModifierOrganization2008-07-01Eric DalciCigitalupdated Time_of_Introduction2008-08-01KDM Analyticsadded/updated white box definitions2008-09-08CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Applicable_Platforms, Causal_Nature, Common_Consequences, Description, Likelihood_of_Exploit, Maintenance_Notes, Relationships, Other_Notes, Relationship_Notes, Taxonomy_Mappings, Weakness_Ordinalities2008-11-24CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Relationships, Taxonomy_Mappings2009-03-10CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Common_Consequences2009-05-27CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Demonstrative_Examples2009-07-17KDM AnalyticsImproved the White_Box_Definition2009-07-27CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Common_Consequences, Other_Notes, Potential_Mitigations, White_Box_Definitions2009-10-29CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Description2011-03-29CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Common_Consequences2011-06-01CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Common_Consequences2011-09-13CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Relationships, Taxonomy_Mappings2012-05-11CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Relationships2014-06-23CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Observed_Examples2014-07-30CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Relationships, Taxonomy_Mappings2017-11-08CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Causal_Nature, Observed_Examples, Relationships, Taxonomy_Mappings, White_Box_Definitions2018-03-27CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Demonstrative_Examples2019-01-03CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Relationships2020-02-24CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Relationships2020-08-20CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Relationships2020-12-10CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Relationships2023-01-31CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Description2023-04-27CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Detection_Factors, Relationships2023-06-29CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Mapping_Notes\",\n    \"Previous Entry Names\": \"N/A\"\n}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n    \"Potential Mitigations\": \"Phase:  RequirementsUse a language that is not susceptible to these issues.

This hole might be difficult for the system administrator to detect. Even if detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:\\n\\nIn the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.\\n\\nThe Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.\",\n    \"Alternate Terms\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Relationships\": \"Relevant to the view \\\"Research Concepts\\\" (CWE-1000)NatureTypeIDNameChildOf344Use of Invariant Value in Dynamically Changing ContextChildOf671Lack of Administrator Control over SecurityChildOf1391Use of Weak CredentialsParentOf259Use of Hard-coded PasswordParentOf321Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic KeyPeerOf257Storing Passwords in a Recoverable FormatRelevant to the view \\\"Software Development\\\" (CWE-699)NatureTypeIDNameMemberOf255Credentials Management ErrorsMemberOf320Key Management ErrorsRelevant to the view \\\"Weaknesses for Simplified Mapping of Published Vulnerabilities\\\" (CWE-1003)NatureTypeIDNameChildOf287Improper AuthenticationRelevant to the view \\\"Architectural Concepts\\\" (CWE-1008)NatureTypeIDNameMemberOf1010Authenticate ActorsRelevant to the view \\\"CISQ Quality Measures (2020)\\\" (CWE-1305)NatureTypeIDNameParentOf259Use of Hard-coded PasswordParentOf321Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic KeyRelevant to the view \\\"CISQ Data Protection Measures\\\" (CWE-1340)NatureTypeIDNameParentOf259Use of Hard-coded PasswordParentOf321Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\",\n    \"Modes of Introduction\": \"PhaseNote\\n\\nArchitecture and DesignREALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.\",\n    \"Applicable Platforms\": \"Languages\\n\\nClass: Not Language-Specific(Undetermined Prevalence)\\n\\nTechnologies\\n\\nClass: Mobile(Undetermined Prevalence)\\n\\nClass: ICS/OT(Often Prevalent)\",\n    \"Common Consequences\": \"ScopeImpactLikelihood\\n\\nAccess ControlTechnical Impact:Bypass Protection MechanismIf hard-coded passwords are used, it is almost certain that malicious users will gain access to the account in question.\\n\\nIntegrityConfidentialityAvailabilityAccess ControlOtherTechnical Impact:Read Application Data; Gain Privileges or Assume Identity; Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands; OtherThis weakness can lead to the exposure of resources or functionality to unintended actors, possibly providing attackers with sensitive information or even execute arbitrary code.\",\n    \"Likelihood of Exploit\": \"High\",\n    \"Demonstrative Examples\": \"Example 1The following code uses a hard-coded password to connect to a database:(bad code)Example Language:Java...DriverManager.getConnection(url, \\\"scott\\\", \\\"tiger\\\");...This is an example of an external hard-coded password on the client-side of a connection. This code will run successfully, but anyone who has access to it will have access to the password. Once the program has shipped, there is no going back from the database user \\\"scott\\\" with a password of \\\"tiger\\\" unless the program is patched. A devious employee with access to this information can use it to break into the system. Even worse, if attackers have access to the bytecode for application, they can use the javap -c command to access the disassembled code, which will contain the values of the passwords used. The result of this operation might look something like the following for the example above:(attack code)javap -c ConnMngr.class22: ldc #36; //String jdbc:mysql://ixne.com/rxsql24: ldc #38; //String scott26: ldc #17; //String tigerExample 2The following code is an example of an internal hard-coded password in the back-end:(bad code)Example Language:Cint VerifyAdmin(char *password) {if (strcmp(password, \\\"Mew!\\\")) {printf(\\\"Incorrect Password!\\\\n\\\");return(0)}printf(\\\"Entering Diagnostic Mode...\\\\n\\\");return(1);}(bad code)Example Language:Javaint VerifyAdmin(String password) {if (!password.equals(\\\"Mew!\\\")) {return(0)}//Diagnostic Modereturn(1);}Every instance of this program can be placed into diagnostic mode with the same password. Even worse is the fact that if this program is distributed as a binary-only distribution, it is very difficult to change that password or disable this \\\"functionality.\\\"Example 3The following code examples attempt to verify a password using a hard-coded cryptographic key.(bad code)Example Language:Cint VerifyAdmin(char *password) {if (strcmp(password,\\\"68af404b513073584c4b6f22b6c63e6b\\\")) {printf(\\\"Incorrect Password!\\\\n\\\");return(0);}printf(\\\"Entering Diagnostic Mode...\\\\n\\\");return(1);}(bad code)Example Language:Javapublic boolean VerifyAdmin(String password) {if (password.equals(\\\"68af404b513073584c4b6f22b6c63e6b\\\")) {System.out.println(\\\"Entering Diagnostic Mode...\\\");return true;}System.out.println(\\\"Incorrect Password!\\\");return false;(bad code)Example Language:C#int VerifyAdmin(String password) {if (password.Equals(\\\"68af404b513073584c4b6f22b6c63e6b\\\")) {Console.WriteLine(\\\"Entering Diagnostic Mode...\\\");return(1);}Console.WriteLine(\\\"Incorrect Password!\\\");return(0);}The cryptographic key is within a hard-coded string value that is compared to the password. It is likely that an attacker will be able to read the key and compromise the system.Example 4The following examples show a portion of properties and configuration files for Java and ASP.NET applications. The files include username and password information but they are stored in cleartext.This Java example shows a properties file with a cleartext username / password pair.(bad code)Example Language:Java# Java Web App ResourceBundle properties file...webapp.ldap.username=secretUsernamewebapp.ldap.password=secretPassword...The following example shows a portion of a configuration file for an ASP.Net application. This configuration file includes username and password information for a connection to a database but the pair is stored in cleartext.(bad code)Example Language:ASP.NET...<connectionStrings><add name=\\\"ud_DEV\\\" connectionString=\\\"connectDB=uDB; uid=db2admin; pwd=password; dbalias=uDB;\\\" providerName=\\\"System.Data.Odbc\\\" /></connectionStrings>...Username and password information should not be included in a configuration file or a properties file in cleartext as this will allow anyone who can read the file access to the resource. If possible, encrypt this information.Example 5In 2022, the OT:ICEFALL study examined products by 10 different Operational Technology (OT) vendors. The researchers reported 56 vulnerabilities and said that the products were \\\"insecure by design\\\" [REF-1283]. If exploited, these vulnerabilities often allowed adversaries to change how the products operated, ranging from denial of service to changing the code that the products executed. Since these products were often used in industries such as power, electrical, water, and others, there could even be safety implications.Multiple vendors used hard-coded credentials in their OT products.\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2022-29953Condition Monitor firmware has a maintenance interface with hard-coded credentialsCVE-2022-29960Engineering Workstation uses hard-coded cryptographic keys that could allow for unathorized filesystem access and privilege escalationCVE-2022-29964Distributed Control System (DCS) has hard-coded passwords for local shell accessCVE-2022-30997Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) has a maintenance service that uses undocumented, hard-coded credentialsCVE-2022-30314Firmware for a Safety Instrumented System (SIS) has hard-coded credentials for access to boot configurationCVE-2022-30271Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a hard-coded SSH private key that is likely to be used in typical deploymentsCVE-2021-37555Telnet service for IoT feeder for dogs and cats has hard-coded password [REF-1288]CVE-2021-35033Firmware for a WiFi router uses a hard-coded password for a BusyBox shell, allowing bypass of authentication through the UART portCVE-2012-3503Installation script has a hard-coded secret token value, allowing attackers to bypass authenticationCVE-2010-2772SCADA system uses a hard-coded password to protect back-end database containing authorization information, exploited by Stuxnet wormCVE-2010-2073FTP server library uses hard-coded usernames and passwords for three default accountsCVE-2010-1573Chain: Router firmware uses hard-coded username and password for access to debug functionality, which can be used to execute arbitrary codeCVE-2008-2369Server uses hard-coded authentication keyCVE-2008-0961Backup product uses hard-coded username and password, allowing attackers to bypass authentication via the RPC interfaceCVE-2008-1160Security appliance uses hard-coded password allowing attackers to gain root accessCVE-2006-7142Drive encryption product stores hard-coded cryptographic keys for encrypted configuration files in executable programsCVE-2005-3716VoIP product uses hard-coded public credentials that cannot be changed, which allows attackers to obtain sensitive informationCVE-2005-3803VoIP product uses hard coded public and private SNMP community strings that cannot be changed, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive informationCVE-2005-0496Backup product contains hard-coded credentials that effectively serve as a back door, which allows remote attackers to access the file system\",\n    \"References\": \"[REF-7] Michael Howard and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDavid LeBlanc. \\\"Writing Secure Code\\\".

Properly protect the key (CWE-320). If you cannot use encryption to protect the file, then make sure that the permissions are as restrictive as possible [REF-7].In Windows environments, the Encrypted File System (EFS) may provide some protection.\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignFor inbound authentication: Rather than hard-code a default username and password, key, or other authentication credentials for first time logins, utilize a \\\"first login\\\" mode that requires the user to enter a unique strong password or key.\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignIf the product must contain hard-coded credentials or they cannot be removed, perform access control checks and limit which entities can access the feature that requires the hard-coded credentials. For example, a feature might only be enabled through the system console instead of through a network connection.\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignFor inbound authentication using passwords: apply strong one-way hashes to passwords and store those hashes in a configuration file or database with appropriate access control. That way, theft of the file/database still requires the attacker to try to crack the password. When handling an incoming password during authentication, take the hash of the password and compare it to the saved hash.Use randomly assigned salts for each separate hash that is generated. This increases the amount of computation that an attacker needs to conduct a brute-force attack, possibly limiting the effectiveness of the rainbow table method.\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignFor front-end to back-end connections: Three solutions are possible, although none are complete.The first suggestion involves the use of generated passwords or keys that are changed automatically and must be entered at given time intervals by a system administrator. These passwords will be held in memory and only be valid for the time intervals.Next, the passwords or keys should be limited at the back end to only performing actions valid for the front end, as opposed to having full access.Finally, the messages sent should be tagged and checksummed with time sensitive values so as to prevent replay-style attacks.\",\n    \"Weakness Ordinalities\": \"OrdinalityDescriptionPrimary(where the weakness exists independent of other weaknesses)\",\n    \"Detection Methods\": \"Black BoxCredential storage in configuration files is findable using black box methods, but the use of hard-coded credentials for an incoming authentication routine typically involves an account that is not visible outside of the code.Effectiveness: ModerateAutomated Static AnalysisAutomated white box techniques have been published for detecting hard-coded credentials for incoming authentication, but there is some expert disagreement regarding their effectiveness and applicability to a broad range of methods.Manual Static AnalysisThis weakness may be detectable using manual code analysis. Unless authentication is decentralized and applied throughout the product, there can be sufficient time for the analyst to find incoming authentication routines and examine the program logic looking for usage of hard-coded credentials. Configuration files could also be analyzed.Note:These may be more effective than strictly automated techniques. This is especially the case with weaknesses that are related to design and business rules.Manual Dynamic AnalysisFor hard-coded credentials in incoming authentication: use monitoring tools that examine the product's process as it interacts with the operating system and the network. This technique is useful in cases when source code is unavailable, if the product was not developed by you, or if you want to verify that the build phase did not introduce any new weaknesses. Examples include debuggers that directly attach to the running process; system-call tracing utilities such as truss (Solaris) and strace (Linux); system activity monitors such as FileMon, RegMon, Process Monitor, and other Sysinternals utilities (Windows); and sniffers and protocol analyzers that monitor network traffic.Attach the monitor to the process and perform a login. Using call trees or similar artifacts from the output, examine the associated behaviors and see if any of them appear to be comparing the input to a fixed string or value.Automated Static Analysis - Binary or BytecodeAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Cost effective for partial coverage:Bytecode Weakness Analysis - including disassembler + source code weakness analysisBinary Weakness Analysis - including disassembler + source code weakness analysisEffectiveness: SOAR PartialManual Static Analysis - Binary or BytecodeAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Highly cost effective:Binary / Bytecode disassembler - then use manual analysis for vulnerabilities & anomaliesEffectiveness: HighDynamic Analysis with Manual Results InterpretationAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Cost effective for partial coverage:Network SnifferForced Path ExecutionEffectiveness: SOAR PartialManual Static Analysis - Source CodeAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Highly cost effective:Focused Manual Spotcheck - Focused manual analysis of sourceManual Source Code Review (not inspections)Effectiveness: HighAutomated Static Analysis - Source CodeAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Highly cost effective:Source code Weakness AnalyzerContext-configured Source Code Weakness AnalyzerEffectiveness: HighAutomated Static AnalysisAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Cost effective for partial coverage:Configuration CheckerEffectiveness: SOAR PartialArchitecture or Design ReviewAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Highly cost effective:Inspection (IEEE 1028 standard) (can apply to requirements, design, source code, etc.)Formal Methods / Correct-By-ConstructionEffectiveness: High\",\n    \"Functional Areas\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Affected Resources\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Memberships\": \"NatureTypeIDNameMemberOf2547PK - Security FeaturesMemberOf724OWASP Top Ten 2004 Category A3 - Broken Authentication and Session ManagementMemberOf7532009 Top 25 - Porous DefensesMemberOf8032010 Top 25 - Porous DefensesMemberOf812OWASP Top Ten 2010 Category A3 - Broken Authentication and Session ManagementMemberOf861The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011) Chapter 18 - Miscellaneous (MSC)MemberOf8662011 Top 25 - Porous DefensesMemberOf884CWE Cross-sectionMemberOf1131CISQ Quality Measures (2016) - SecurityMemberOf1152SEI CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java - Guidelines 49.

Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.\\n\\nIt is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.\\n\\nSince the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered \\\"unsafe\\\" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.\\n\\nFor a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software.

This means an attacker with access to cloud-rented computing power will now be able to provide a malicious bitstream with the same hash value, thereby defeating the purpose for which the hash was used.This issue could have been avoided with better design.(good code)Example Language:OtherThe manufacturer could have chosen a cryptographic solution that is recommended by the wide security community (including standard-setting bodies like NIST) and is not expected to be broken (or even better, weakened) within the reasonable life expectancy of the hardware product. In this case, the architects could have used SHA-2 or SHA-3, even if it meant that such choice would cost extra.Example 3In 2022, the OT:ICEFALL study examined products by 10 different Operational Technology (OT) vendors. The researchers reported 56 vulnerabilities and said that the products were \\\"insecure by design\\\" [REF-1283]. If exploited, these vulnerabilities often allowed adversaries to change how the products operated, ranging from denial of service to changing the code that the products executed. Since these products were often used in industries such as power, electrical, water, and others, there could even be safety implications.Multiple OT products used weak cryptography.\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2022-30273SCADA-based protocol supports a legacy encryption mode that uses Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode, which leaks patterns in messages and cannot protect integrityCVE-2022-30320Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) uses a protocol with a cryptographically insecure hashing algorithm for passwords.CVE-2008-3775Product uses \\\"ROT-25\\\" to obfuscate the password in the registry.CVE-2007-4150product only uses \\\"XOR\\\" to obfuscate sensitive dataCVE-2007-5460product only uses \\\"XOR\\\" and a fixed key to obfuscate sensitive dataCVE-2005-4860Product substitutes characters with other characters in a fixed way, and also leaves certain input characters unchanged.CVE-2002-2058Attackers can infer private IP addresses by dividing each octet by the MD5 hash of '20'.CVE-2008-3188Product uses DES when MD5 has been specified in the configuration, resulting in weaker-than-expected password hashes.CVE-2005-2946Default configuration of product uses MD5 instead of stronger algorithms that are available, simplifying forgery of certificates.CVE-2007-6013Product uses the hash of a hash for authentication, allowing attackers to gain privileges if they can obtain the original hash.\",\n    \"References\": \"[REF-280] Bruce Schneier. \\\"Applied Cryptography\\\".

Select a well-vetted algorithm that is currently considered to be strong by experts in the field, and use well-tested implementations. As with all cryptographic mechanisms, the source code should be available for analysis.For example, US government systems require FIPS 140-2 certification [REF-1192].Do not develop custom or private cryptographic algorithms. They will likely be exposed to attacks that are well-understood by cryptographers. Reverse engineering techniques are mature. If the algorithm can be compromised if attackers find out how it works, then it is especially weak.Periodically ensure that the cryptography has not become obsolete. Some older algorithms, once thought to require a billion years of computing time, can now be broken in days or hours. This includes MD4, MD5, SHA1, DES, and other algorithms that were once regarded as strong. [REF-267]\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignEnsure that the design allows one cryptographic algorithm to be replaced with another in the next generation or version. Where possible, use wrappers to make the interfaces uniform. This will make it easier to upgrade to stronger algorithms. With hardware, design the product at the Intellectual Property (IP) level so that one cryptographic algorithm can be replaced with another in the next generation of the hardware product.Effectiveness: Defense in Depth\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignCarefully manage and protect cryptographic keys (seeCWE-320). If the keys can be guessed or stolen, then the strength of the cryptography itself is irrelevant.\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignStrategy:  Libraries or FrameworksUse a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.Industry-standard implementations will save development time and may be more likely to avoid errors that can occur during implementation of cryptographic algorithms. Consider the ESAPI Encryption feature.\\n\\nPhases:  Implementation; Architecture and DesignWhen using industry-approved techniques, use them correctly.

Use an \\\"accept known good\\\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \\\"boat\\\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \\\"red\\\" or \\\"blue.\\\"Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Output EncodingWhile it is risky to use dynamically-generated query strings, code, or commands that mix control and data together, sometimes it may be unavoidable. Properly quote arguments and escape any special characters within those arguments. The most conservative approach is to escape or filter all characters that do not pass an extremely strict allowlist (such as everything that is not alphanumeric or white space). If some special characters are still needed, such as white space, wrap each argument in quotes after the escaping/filtering step. Be careful of argument injection (CWE-88).\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Input ValidationInputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180).

If an attacker submits a malicious string, such as(attack code)Wiley Hacker\\\\r\\\\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\\\\r\\\\nthen the HTTP response would be split into two responses of the following form:(result)HTTP/1.1 200 OK...Set-Cookie: author=Wiley HackerHTTP/1.1 200 OK...The second response is completely controlled by the attacker and can be constructed with any header and body content desired. The ability to construct arbitrary HTTP responses permits a variety of resulting attacks, including:cross-user defacementweb and browser cache poisoningcross-site scriptingpage hijackingExample 2An attacker can make a single request to a vulnerable server that will cause the server to create two responses, the second of which may be misinterpreted as a response to a different request, possibly one made by another user sharing the same TCP connection with the server.Cross-User Defacement can be accomplished by convincing the user to submit the malicious request themselves, or remotely in situations where the attacker and the user share a common TCP connection to the server, such as a shared proxy server.In the best case, an attacker can leverage this ability to convince users that the application has been hacked, causing users to lose confidence in the security of the application.In the worst case, an attacker may provide specially crafted content designed to mimic the behavior of the application but redirect private information, such as account numbers and passwords, back to the attacker.Example 3The impact of a maliciously constructed response can be magnified if it is cached, either by a web cache used by multiple users or even the browser cache of a single user.Cache Poisoning: if a response is cached in a shared web cache, such as those commonly found in proxy servers, then all users of that cache will continue receive the malicious content until the cache entry is purged. Similarly, if the response is cached in the browser of an individual user, then that user will continue to receive the malicious content until the cache entry is purged, although the user of the local browser instance will be affected.Example 4Once attackers have control of the responses sent by an application, they have a choice of a variety of malicious content to provide users.Cross-Site Scripting: cross-site scripting is common form of attack where malicious JavaScript or other code included in a response is executed in the user's browser.The variety of attacks based on XSS is almost limitless, but they commonly include transmitting private data like cookies or other session information to the attacker, redirecting the victim to web content controlled by the attacker, or performing other malicious operations on the user's machine under the guise of the vulnerable site.The most common and dangerous attack vector against users of a vulnerable application uses JavaScript to transmit session and authentication information back to the attacker who can then take complete control of the victim's account.Example 5In addition to using a vulnerable application to send malicious content to a user, the same weakness can also be leveraged to redirect sensitive content generated by the server to the attacker instead of the intended user.Page Hijacking: by submitting a request that results in two responses, the intended response from the server and the response generated by the attacker, an attacker can cause an intermediate node, such as a shared proxy server, to misdirect a response generated by the server to the attacker instead of the intended user.Because the request made by the attacker generates two responses, the first is interpreted as a response to the attacker's request, while the second remains in limbo. When the user makes a legitimate request through the same TCP connection, the attacker's request is already waiting and is interpreted as a response to the victim's request. The attacker then sends a second request to the server, to which the proxy server responds with the server generated request intended for the victim, thereby compromising any sensitive information in the headers or body of the response intended for the victim.\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2020-15811Chain: Proxy uses a substring search instead of parsing the Transfer-Encoding header (CWE-697), allowing request splitting (CWE-113) and cache poisoningCVE-2021-41084Scala-based HTTP interface allows request splitting and response splitting through header names, header values, status reasons, and URIsCVE-2018-12116Javascript-based framework allows request splitting through a path option of an HTTP requestCVE-2004-2146Application accepts CRLF in an object ID, allowing HTTP response splitting.CVE-2004-1656Shopping cart allows HTTP response splitting to perform HTML injection via CRLF in a parameter for a urlCVE-2005-2060Bulletin board allows response splitting via CRLF in parameter.CVE-2004-2512Response splitting via CRLF in PHPSESSID.CVE-2005-1951e-commerce app allows HTTP response splitting using CRLF in object id parameters\",\n    \"References\": \"[REF-43] OWASP. \\\"OWASP TOP 10\\\". 2007-05-18. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<https://github.com/owasp-top/owasp-top-2007>.[REF-44] Michael Howard, David LeBlanc\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand John Viega. \\\"24 Deadly Sins of Software Security\\\". \\\"Sin 2: Web-Server Related Vulnerabilities (XSS, XSRF, and Response Splitting).\\\" Page 31.

Use an \\\"accept known good\\\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. If an input does not strictly conform to specifications, reject it or transform it into something that conforms.When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \\\"boat\\\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \\\"red\\\" or \\\"blue.\\\"Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Output EncodingUse and specify an output encoding that can be handled by the downstream component that is reading the output. Common encodings include ISO-8859-1, UTF-7, and UTF-8. When an encoding is not specified, a downstream component may choose a different encoding, either by assuming a default encoding or automatically inferring which encoding is being used, which can be erroneous. When the encodings are inconsistent, the downstream component might treat some character or byte sequences as special, even if they are not special in the original encoding. Attackers might then be able to exploit this discrepancy and conduct injection attacks; they even might be able to bypass protection mechanisms that assume the original encoding is also being used by the downstream component.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Input ValidationInputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180).

Notice that the return value is not checked before the memcpy operation (CWE-252), so -1 can be passed as the size argument to memcpy() (CWE-805). Because memcpy() assumes that the value is unsigned, it will be interpreted as MAXINT-1 (CWE-195), and therefore will copy far more memory than is likely available to the destination buffer (CWE-787,CWE-788).Example 3This code takes an IP address from the user and verifies that it is well formed. It then looks up the hostname and copies it into a buffer.(bad code)Example Language:Cvoid host_lookup(char *user_supplied_addr){struct hostent *hp;in_addr_t *addr;char hostname[64];in_addr_t inet_addr(const char *cp);/*routine that ensures user_supplied_addr is in the right format for conversion */validate_addr_form(user_supplied_addr);addr = inet_addr(user_supplied_addr);hp = gethostbyaddr( addr, sizeof(struct in_addr), AF_INET);strcpy(hostname, hp->h_name);}This function allocates a buffer of 64 bytes to store the hostname. However, there is no guarantee that the hostname will not be larger than 64 bytes. If an attacker specifies an address which resolves to a very large hostname, then the function may overwrite sensitive data or even relinquish control flow to the attacker.Note that this example also contains an unchecked return value (CWE-252) that can lead to a NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476).Example 4This code applies an encoding procedure to an input string and stores it into a buffer.(bad code)Example Language:Cchar * copy_input(char *user_supplied_string){int i, dst_index;char *dst_buf = (char*)malloc(4*sizeof(char) * MAX_SIZE);if ( MAX_SIZE <= strlen(user_supplied_string) ){die(\\\"user string too long, die evil hacker!\\\");}dst_index = 0;for ( i = 0; i < strlen(user_supplied_string); i++ ){if( '&' == user_supplied_string[i] ){dst_buf[dst_index++] = '&';dst_buf[dst_index++] = 'a';dst_buf[dst_index++] = 'm';dst_buf[dst_index++] = 'p';dst_buf[dst_index++] = ';';}else if ('<' == user_supplied_string[i] ){/* encode to &lt; */}else dst_buf[dst_index++] = user_supplied_string[i];}return dst_buf;}The programmer attempts to encode the ampersand character in the user-controlled string. However, the length of the string is validated before the encoding procedure is applied. Furthermore, the programmer assumes encoding expansion will only expand a given character by a factor of 4, while the encoding of the ampersand expands by 5. As a result, when the encoding procedure expands the string it is possible to overflow the destination buffer if the attacker provides a string of many ampersands.Example 5In the following C/C++ code, a utility function is used to trim trailing whitespace from a character string. The function copies the input string to a local character string and uses a while statement to remove the trailing whitespace by moving backward through the string and overwriting whitespace with a NUL character.(bad code)Example Language:Cchar* trimTrailingWhitespace(char *strMessage, int length) {char *retMessage;char *message = malloc(sizeof(char)*(length+1));// copy input string to a temporary stringchar message[length+1];int index;for (index = 0; index < length; index++) {message[index] = strMessage[index];}message[index] = '\\\\0';// trim trailing whitespaceint len = index-1;while (isspace(message[len])) {message[len] = '\\\\0';len--;}// return string without trailing whitespaceretMessage = message;return retMessage;}However, this function can cause a buffer underwrite if the input character string contains all whitespace. On some systems the while statement will move backwards past the beginning of a character string and will call the isspace() function on an address outside of the bounds of the local buffer.Example 6The following code allocates memory for a maximum number of widgets. It then gets a user-specified number of widgets, making sure that the user does not request too many. It then initializes the elements of the array using InitializeWidget(). Because the number of widgets can vary for each request, the code inserts a NULL pointer to signify the location of the last widget.(bad code)Example Language:Cint i;unsigned int numWidgets;Widget **WidgetList;numWidgets = GetUntrustedSizeValue();if ((numWidgets == 0) || (numWidgets > MAX_NUM_WIDGETS)) {ExitError(\\\"Incorrect number of widgets requested!\\\");}WidgetList = (Widget **)malloc(numWidgets * sizeof(Widget *));printf(\\\"WidgetList ptr=%p\\\\n\\\", WidgetList);for(i=0; i<numWidgets; i++) {WidgetList[i] = InitializeWidget();}WidgetList[numWidgets] = NULL;showWidgets(WidgetList);However, this code contains an off-by-one calculation error (CWE-193). It allocates exactly enough space to contain the specified number of widgets, but it does not include the space for the NULL pointer. As a result, the allocated buffer is smaller than it is supposed to be (CWE-131). So if the user ever requests MAX_NUM_WIDGETS, there is an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) when the NULL is assigned. Depending on the environment and compilation settings, this could cause memory corruption.Example 7The following is an example of code that may result in a buffer underwrite. This code is attempting to replace the substring \\\"Replace Me\\\" in destBuf with the string stored in srcBuf. It does so by using the function strstr(), which returns a pointer to the found substring in destBuf.

Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer.Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignStrategy:  Libraries or FrameworksUse a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.Note:This is not a complete solution, since many buffer overflows are not related to strings.\\n\\nPhases:  Operation; Build and CompilationStrategy:  Environment HardeningUse automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking.D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail.Effectiveness: Defense in DepthNote:This is not necessarily a complete solution, since these mechanisms only detect certain types of overflows. In addition, the result is still a denial of service, since the typical response is to exit the application.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationConsider adhering to the following rules when allocating and managing an application's memory:Double check that the buffer is as large as specified.When using functions that accept a number of bytes to copy, such as strncpy(), be aware that if the destination buffer size is equal to the source buffer size, it may not NULL-terminate the string.Check buffer boundaries if accessing the buffer in a loop and make sure there is no danger of writing past the allocated space.If necessary, truncate all input strings to a reasonable length before passing them to the copy and concatenation functions.\\n\\nPhases:  Operation; Build and CompilationStrategy:  Environment HardeningRun or compile the software using features or extensions that randomly arrange the positions of a program's executable and libraries in memory. Because this makes the addresses unpredictable, it can prevent an attacker from reliably jumping to exploitable code.Examples include Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) [REF-58] [REF-60] and Position-Independent Executables (PIE) [REF-64]. Imported modules may be similarly realigned if their default memory addresses conflict with other modules, in a process known as \\\"rebasing\\\" (for Windows) and \\\"prelinking\\\" (for Linux) [REF-1332] using randomly generated addresses. ASLR for libraries cannot be used in conjunction with prelink since it would require relocating the libraries at run-time, defeating the whole purpose of prelinking.For more information on these techniques see D3-SAOR (Segment Address Offset Randomization) from D3FEND [REF-1335].Effectiveness: Defense in DepthNote:These techniques do not provide a complete solution. For instance, exploits frequently use a bug that discloses memory addresses in order to maximize reliability of code execution [REF-1337]. It has also been shown that a side-channel attack can bypass ASLR [REF-1333]\\n\\nPhase:  OperationStrategy:  Environment HardeningUse a CPU and operating system that offers Data Execution Protection (using hardware NX or XD bits) or the equivalent techniques that simulate this feature in software, such as PaX [REF-60] [REF-61]. These techniques ensure that any instruction executed is exclusively at a memory address that is part of the code segment.For more information on these techniques see D3-PSEP (Process Segment Execution Prevention) from D3FEND [REF-1336].Effectiveness: Defense in DepthNote:This is not a complete solution, since buffer overflows could be used to overwrite nearby variables to modify the software's state in dangerous ways. In addition, it cannot be used in cases in which self-modifying code is required. Finally, an attack could still cause a denial of service, since the typical response is to exit the application.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationReplace unbounded copy functions with analogous functions that support length arguments, such as strcpy with strncpy. Create these if they are not available.Effectiveness: ModerateNote:This approach is still susceptible to calculation errors, including issues such as off-by-one errors (CWE-193) and incorrectly calculating buffer lengths (CWE-131).\",\n    \"Weakness Ordinalities\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Detection Methods\": \"Automated Static AnalysisThis weakness can often be detected using automated static analysis tools. Many modern tools use data flow analysis or constraint-based techniques to minimize the number of false positives.Automated static analysis generally does not account for environmental considerations when reporting out-of-bounds memory operations. This can make it difficult for users to determine which warnings should be investigated first. For example, an analysis tool might report buffer overflows that originate from command line arguments in a program that is not expected to run with setuid or other special privileges.Effectiveness: HighNote:Detection techniques for buffer-related errors are more mature than for most other weakness types.Automated Dynamic AnalysisThis weakness can be detected using dynamic tools and techniques that interact with the software using large test suites with many diverse inputs, such as fuzz testing (fuzzing), robustness testing, and fault injection.

Note: The stack buffer was added to make exploitation more simple.Example 2The following code copies a command line argument into a buffer using snprintf().(bad code)Example Language:Cint main(int argc, char **argv){char buf[128];...snprintf(buf,128,argv[1]);}This code allows an attacker to view the contents of the stack and write to the stack using a command line argument containing a sequence of formatting directives. The attacker can read from the stack by providing more formatting directives, such as %x, than the function takes as arguments to be formatted. (In this example, the function takes no arguments to be formatted.) By using the %n formatting directive, the attacker can write to the stack, causing snprintf() to write the number of bytes output thus far to the specified argument (rather than reading a value from the argument, which is the intended behavior). A sophisticated version of this attack will use four staggered writes to completely control the value of a pointer on the stack.Example 3Certain implementations make more advanced attacks even easier by providing format directives that control the location in memory to read from or write to. An example of these directives is shown in the following code, written for glibc:(bad code)Example Language:Cprintf(\\\"%d %d %1$d %1$d\\\\n\\\", 5, 9);This code produces the following output: 5 9 5 5 It is also possible to use half-writes (%hn) to accurately control arbitrary DWORDS in memory, which greatly reduces the complexity needed to execute an attack that would otherwise require four staggered writes, such as the one mentioned in the first example.\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2002-1825format string in Perl programCVE-2001-0717format string in bad call to syslog functionCVE-2002-0573format string in bad call to syslog functionCVE-2002-1788format strings in NNTP server responsesCVE-2006-2480Format string vulnerability exploited by triggering errors or warnings, as demonstrated via format string specifiers in a .bmp filename.CVE-2007-2027Chain: untrusted search path enabling resultant format string by loading malicious internationalization messages\",\n    \"References\": \"[REF-116] Steve Christey. \\\"Format String Vulnerabilities in Perl Programs\\\". <https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2005/Dec/91>.URL validated: 2023-04-07.[REF-117] Hal Burch and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tRobert C.

Memory or disk consumption, control flow or variable alteration, and data corruption may result from format string exploitation in applications written in other languages such as Perl, PHP, Python, etc.OtherWhile Format String vulnerabilities typically fall under the Buffer Overflow category, technically they are not overflowed buffers. The Format String vulnerability is fairly new (circa 1999) and stems from the fact that there is no realistic way for a function that takes a variable number of arguments to determine just how many arguments were passed in. The most common functions that take a variable number of arguments, including C-runtime functions, are the printf() family of calls. The Format String problem appears in a number of ways. A *printf() call without a format specifier is dangerous and can be exploited. For example, printf(input); is exploitable, while printf(y, input); is not exploitable in that context. The result of the first call, used incorrectly, allows for an attacker to be able to peek at stack memory since the input string will be used as the format specifier. The attacker can stuff the input string with format specifiers and begin reading stack values, since the remaining parameters will be pulled from the stack. Worst case, this improper use may give away enough control to allow an arbitrary value (or values in the case of an exploit program) to be written into the memory of the running program.Frequently targeted entities are file names, process names, identifiers.Format string problems are a classic C/C++ issue that are now rare due to the ease of discovery. One main reason format string vulnerabilities can be exploited is due to the %n operator. The %n operator will write the number of characters, which have been printed by the format string therefore far, to the memory pointed to by its argument. Through skilled creation of a format string, a malicious user may use values on the stack to create a write-what-where condition. Once this is achieved, they can execute arbitrary code. Other operators can be used as well; for example, a %9999s operator could also trigger a buffer overflow, or when used in file-formatting functions like fprintf, it can generate a much larger output than intended.\",\n    \"Taxonomy Mappings\": \"Mapped Taxonomy NameNode IDFitMapped Node NamePLOVERFormat string vulnerability7 Pernicious KingdomsFormat StringCLASPFormat string problemCERT C Secure CodingFIO30-CExactExclude user input from format stringsCERT C Secure CodingFIO47-CCWE More SpecificUse valid format stringsOWASP Top Ten 2004A1CWE More SpecificUnvalidated InputWASC6Format StringThe CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011)IDS06-JExclude user input from format stringsSEI CERT Perl Coding StandardIDS30-PLExactExclude user input from format stringsSoftware Fault PatternsSFP24Tainted input to commandOMG ASCSMASCSM-CWE-134\",\n    \"Related Attack Patterns\": \"CAPEC-IDAttack Pattern NameCAPEC-135Format String InjectionCAPEC-67String Format Overflow in syslog()\"\n}"}]}

All files are stored in a single directory.(bad code)Example Language:Perlmy $dataPath = \\\"/users/cwe/profiles\\\";my $username = param(\\\"user\\\");my $profilePath = $dataPath . \\\"/\\\" . $username;open(my $fh, \\\"<\\\", $profilePath) || ExitError(\\\"profile read error: $profilePath\\\");print \\\"<ul>\\\\n\\\";while (<$fh>) {print \\\"<li>$_</li>\\\\n\\\";}print \\\"</ul>\\\\n\\\";While the programmer intends to access files such as \\\"/users/cwe/profiles/alice\\\" or \\\"/users/cwe/profiles/bob\\\", there is no verification of the incoming user parameter. An attacker could provide a string such as:(attack code)../../../etc/passwdThe program would generate a profile pathname like this:(result)/users/cwe/profiles/../../../etc/passwdWhen the file is opened, the operating system resolves the \\\"../\\\" during path canonicalization and actually accesses this file:(result)/etc/passwdAs a result, the attacker could read the entire text of the password file.Notice how this code also contains an error message information leak (CWE-209) if the user parameter does not produce a file that exists: the full pathname is provided. Because of the lack of output encoding of the file that is retrieved, there might also be a cross-site scripting problem (CWE-79) if profile contains any HTML, but other code would need to be examined.Example 3The following code demonstrates the unrestricted upload of a file with a Java servlet and a path traversal vulnerability. The action attribute of an HTML form is sending the upload file request to the Java servlet.(good code)Example Language:HTML<form action=\\\"FileUploadServlet\\\" method=\\\"post\\\" enctype=\\\"multipart/form-data\\\">Choose a file to upload:<input type=\\\"file\\\" name=\\\"filename\\\"/><br/><input type=\\\"submit\\\" name=\\\"submit\\\" value=\\\"Submit\\\"/></form>When submitted the Java servlet's doPost method will receive the request, extract the name of the file from the Http request header, read the file contents from the request and output the file to the local upload directory.(bad code)Example Language:Javapublic class FileUploadServlet extends HttpServlet {...protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {response.setContentType(\\\"text/html\\\");PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();String contentType = request.getContentType();// the starting position of the boundary headerint ind = contentType.indexOf(\\\"boundary=\\\");String boundary = contentType.substring(ind+9);String pLine = new String();String uploadLocation = new String(UPLOAD_DIRECTORY_STRING); //Constant value// verify that content type is multipart form dataif (contentType != null && contentType.indexOf(\\\"multipart/form-data\\\") != -1) {// extract the filename from the Http headerBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(request.getInputStream()));...pLine = br.readLine();String filename = pLine.substring(pLine.lastIndexOf(\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\"), pLine.lastIndexOf(\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\"));...// output the file to the local upload directorytry {BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(uploadLocation+filename, true));for (String line; (line=br.readLine())!=null; ) {if (line.indexOf(boundary) == -1) {bw.write(line);bw.newLine();bw.flush();}} //end of for loopbw.close();} catch (IOException ex) {...}// output successful upload response HTML page}// output unsuccessful upload response HTML pageelse{...}}...}This code does not perform a check on the type of the file being uploaded (CWE-434). This could allow an attacker to upload any executable file or other file with malicious code.Additionally, the creation of the BufferedWriter object is subject to relative path traversal (CWE-23). Since the code does not check the filename that is provided in the header, an attacker can use \\\"../\\\" sequences to write to files outside of the intended directory. Depending on the executing environment, the attacker may be able to specify arbitrary files to write to, leading to a wide variety of consequences, from code execution, XSS (CWE-79), or system crash.\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2022-45918Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \\\"../\\\" sequences (CWE-24)CVE-2019-20916Python package manager does not correctly restrict the filename specified in a Content-Disposition header, allowing arbitrary file read using path traversal sequences such as \\\"../\\\"CVE-2022-24877directory traversal in Go-based Kubernetes operator app allows accessing data from the controller's pod file system via ../ sequences in a yaml fileCVE-2020-4053a Kubernetes package manager written in Go allows malicious plugins to inject path traversal sequences into a plugin archive (\\\"Zip slip\\\") to copy a file outside the intended directoryCVE-2021-21972Chain: Cloud computing virtualization platform does not require authentication for upload of a tar format file (CWE-306), then uses .. path traversal sequences (CWE-23) in the file to access unexpected files, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.CVE-2019-10743Go-based archive library allows extraction of files to locations outside of the target folder with \\\"../\\\" path traversal sequences in filenames in a zip file, aka \\\"Zip Slip\\\"CVE-2002-0298Server allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via certain HTTP GET requests containing a %2e%2e (encoded dot-dot), several \\\"/../\\\" sequences, or several \\\"../\\\" in a URI.CVE-2002-0661\\\"\\\\\\\" not in denylist for web server, allowing path traversal attacks when the server is run in Windows and other OSes.CVE-2002-0946Arbitrary files may be read files via ..\\\\ (dot dot) sequences in an HTTP request.CVE-2002-1042Directory traversal vulnerability in search engine for web server allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via \\\"..\\\\\\\" sequences in queries.CVE-2002-1209Directory traversal vulnerability in FTP server allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via \\\"..\\\\\\\" sequences in a GET request.CVE-2002-1178Directory traversal vulnerability in servlet allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via \\\"..\\\\\\\" sequences in an HTTP request.CVE-2002-1987Protection mechanism checks for \\\"/..\\\" but doesn't account for Windows-specific \\\"\\\\..\\\" allowing read of arbitrary files.CVE-2005-2142Directory traversal vulnerability in FTP server allows remote authenticated attackers to list arbitrary directories via a \\\"\\\\..\\\" sequence in an LS command.CVE-2002-0160The administration function in Access Control Server allows remote attackers to read HTML, Java class, and image files outside the web root via a \\\"..\\\\..\\\" sequence in the URL to port 2002.CVE-2001-0467\\\"\\\\...\\\" in web serverCVE-2001-0963\\\"...\\\" in cd command in FTP serverCVE-2001-1193\\\"...\\\" in cd command in FTP serverCVE-2001-1131\\\"...\\\" in cd command in FTP serverCVE-2001-0480read of arbitrary files and directories using GET or CD with \\\"...\\\" in Windows-based FTP server.CVE-2002-0288read files using \\\".\\\" and Unicode-encoded \\\"/\\\" or \\\"\\\\\\\" characters in the URL.CVE-2003-0313Directory listing of web server using \\\"...\\\"CVE-2005-1658Triple dotCVE-2000-0240read files via \\\"/........../\\\" in URLCVE-2000-0773read files via \\\"....\\\" in web serverCVE-1999-1082read files via \\\"......\\\" in web server (doubled triple dot?)CVE-2004-2121read files via \\\"......\\\" in web server (doubled triple dot?)CVE-2001-0491multiple attacks using \\\"..\\\", \\\"...\\\", and \\\"....\\\" in different commandsCVE-2001-0615\\\"...\\\" or \\\"....\\\" in chat serverCVE-2005-2169chain: \\\".../...//\\\" bypasses protection mechanism using regexp's that remove \\\"../\\\" resulting in collapse into an unsafe value \\\"../\\\" (CWE-182) and resultant path traversal.CVE-2005-0202\\\".../....///\\\" bypasses regexp's that remove \\\"./\\\" and \\\"../\\\"CVE-2004-1670Mail server allows remote attackers to create arbitrary directories via a \\\"..\\\" or rename arbitrary files via a \\\"....//\\\" in user supplied parameters.\",\n    \"References\": \"[REF-192] OWASP. \\\"OWASP Attack listing\\\". <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Relative_Path_Traversal>.[REF-62] Mark Dowd, John McDonald\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand Justin Schuh. \\\"The Art of Software Security Assessment\\\".

Use an \\\"accept known good\\\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \\\"boat\\\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \\\"red\\\" or \\\"blue.\\\"Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.When validating filenames, use stringent allowlists that limit the character set to be used. If feasible, only allow a single \\\".\\\" character in the filename to avoid weaknesses such asCWE-23, and exclude directory separators such as \\\"/\\\" to avoidCWE-36. Use a list of allowable file extensions, which will help to avoidCWE-434.Do not rely exclusively on a filtering mechanism that removes potentially dangerous characters. This is equivalent to a denylist, which may be incomplete (CWE-184). For example, filtering \\\"/\\\" is insufficient protection if the filesystem also supports the use of \\\"\\\\\\\" as a directory separator. Another possible error could occur when the filtering is applied in a way that still produces dangerous data (CWE-182). For example, if \\\"../\\\" sequences are removed from the \\\".../...//\\\" string in a sequential fashion, two instances of \\\"../\\\" would be removed from the original string, but the remaining characters would still form the \\\"../\\\" string.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Input ValidationInputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180). Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice (CWE-174). Such errors could be used to bypass allowlist validation schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked.Use a built-in path canonicalization function (such as realpath() in C) that produces the canonical version of the pathname, which effectively removes \\\"..\\\" sequences and symbolic links (CWE-23,CWE-59).

This can lead to denial of service conditions, or modify control flow in unexpected ways. In some cases, an attacker can \\\"pre-initialize\\\" the variable using previous actions, which might enable code execution. This can cause a race condition if a lock variable check passes when it should not.\\n\\nAuthorizationOtherTechnical Impact:OtherStrings that are not initialized are especially dangerous, since many functions expect a null at the end -- and only at the end -- of a string.\",\n    \"Likelihood of Exploit\": \"High\",\n    \"Demonstrative Examples\": \"Example 1This code prints a greeting using information stored in a POST request:(bad code)Example Language:PHPif (isset($_POST['names'])) {$nameArray = $_POST['names'];}echo \\\"Hello \\\" . $nameArray['first'];This code checks if the POST array 'names' is set before assigning it to the $nameArray variable. However, if the array is not in the POST request, $nameArray will remain uninitialized. This will cause an error when the array is accessed to print the greeting message, which could lead to further exploit.Example 2The following switch statement is intended to set the values of the variables aN and bN before they are used:(bad code)Example Language:Cint aN, Bn;switch (ctl) {case -1:aN = 0;bN = 0;break;case 0:aN = i;bN = -i;break;case 1:aN = i + NEXT_SZ;bN = i - NEXT_SZ;break;default:aN = -1;aN = -1;break;}repaint(aN, bN);In the default case of the switch statement, the programmer has accidentally set the value of aN twice. As a result, bN will have an undefined value. Most uninitialized variable issues result in general software reliability problems, but if attackers can intentionally trigger the use of an uninitialized variable, they might be able to launch a denial of service attack by crashing the program. Under the right circumstances, an attacker may be able to control the value of an uninitialized variable by affecting the values on the stack prior to the invocation of the function.Example 3This example will leave test_string in an unknown condition when i is the same value as err_val, because test_string is not initialized (CWE-456). Depending on where this code segment appears (e.g. within a function body), test_string might be random if it is stored on the heap or stack. If the variable is declared in static memory, it might be zero or NULL. Compiler optimization might contribute to the unpredictability of this address.(bad code)Example Language:Cchar *test_string;if (i != err_val){test_string = \\\"Hello World!\\\";}printf(\\\"%s\\\", test_string);When the printf() is reached, test_string might be an unexpected address, so the printf might print junk strings (CWE-457).To fix this code, there are a couple approaches to\\n\\t\\t\\t  making sure that test_string has been properly set once\\n\\t\\t\\t  it reaches the printf().One solution would be to set test_string to an\\n\\t\\t\\t  acceptable default before the conditional:(good code)Example Language:Cchar *test_string = \\\"Done at the beginning\\\";if (i != err_val){test_string = \\\"Hello World!\\\";}printf(\\\"%s\\\", test_string);Another solution is to ensure that each\\n\\t\\t\\t  branch of the conditional - including the default/else\\n\\t\\t\\t  branch - could ensure that test_string is set:(good code)Example Language:Cchar *test_string;if (i != err_val){test_string = \\\"Hello World!\\\";}else {test_string = \\\"Done on the other side!\\\";}printf(\\\"%s\\\", test_string);\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2019-15900Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).CVE-2008-3688Chain: A denial of service may be caused by an uninitialized variable (CWE-457) allowing an infinite loop (CWE-835) resulting from a connection to an unresponsive server.CVE-2008-0081Uninitialized variable leads to code execution in popular desktop application.CVE-2007-4682Crafted input triggers dereference of an uninitialized object pointer.CVE-2007-3468Crafted audio file triggers crash when an uninitialized variable is used.CVE-2007-2728Uninitialized random seed variable used.\",\n    \"References\": \"[REF-18] Secure Software, Inc.. \\\"The CLASP Application Security Process\\\". 2005. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<https://cwe.mitre.org/documents/sources/TheCLASPApplicationSecurityProcess.pdf>.[REF-436] mercy. \\\"Exploiting Uninitialized Data\\\". 2006-01. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<http://www.felinemenace.org/~mercy/papers/UBehavior/UBehavior.zip>.[REF-437] Microsoft Security Vulnerability Research & Defense. \\\"MS08-014 : The Case of the Uninitialized Stack Variable Vulnerability\\\". 2008-03-11. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2008/03/ms08-014-the-case-of-the-uninitialized-stack-variable-vulnerability/>.URL validated: 2023-04-07.[REF-44] Michael Howard, David LeBlanc\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand John Viega. \\\"24 Deadly Sins of Software Security\\\". \\\"Sin 8: C++ Catastrophes.\\\" Page 143.

If an attacker is able to spoof the IP, they may be able to bypass the authentication mechanism.Example 2Both of these examples check if a request is from a trusted address before responding to the request.(bad code)Example Language:Csd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);serv.sin_family = AF_INET;serv.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(INADDR_ANY);servr.sin_port = htons(1008);bind(sd, (struct sockaddr *) & serv, sizeof(serv));while (1) {memset(msg, 0x0, MAX_MSG);clilen = sizeof(cli);if (inet_ntoa(cli.sin_addr)==getTrustedAddress()) {n = recvfrom(sd, msg, MAX_MSG, 0, (struct sockaddr *) & cli, &clilen);}}(bad code)Example Language:Javawhile(true) {DatagramPacket rp=new DatagramPacket(rData,rData.length);outSock.receive(rp);String in = new String(p.getData(),0, rp.getLength());InetAddress clientIPAddress = rp.getAddress();int port = rp.getPort();if (isTrustedAddress(clientIPAddress) & secretKey.equals(in)) {out = secret.getBytes();DatagramPacket sp =new DatagramPacket(out,out.length, IPAddress, port); outSock.send(sp);}}The code only verifies the address as stored in the request packet. An attacker can spoof this address, thus impersonating a trusted client.Example 3The following code samples use a DNS lookup in order to decide whether or not an inbound request is from a trusted host. If an attacker can poison the DNS cache, they can gain trusted status.(bad code)Example Language:Cstruct hostent *hp;struct in_addr myaddr;char* tHost = \\\"trustme.example.com\\\";myaddr.s_addr=inet_addr(ip_addr_string);hp = gethostbyaddr((char *) &myaddr, sizeof(struct in_addr), AF_INET);if (hp && !strncmp(hp->h_name, tHost, sizeof(tHost))) {trusted = true;} else {trusted = false;}(bad code)Example Language:JavaString ip = request.getRemoteAddr();InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getByName(ip);if (addr.getCanonicalHostName().endsWith(\\\"trustme.com\\\")) {trusted = true;}(bad code)Example Language:C#IPAddress hostIPAddress = IPAddress.Parse(RemoteIpAddress);IPHostEntry hostInfo = Dns.GetHostByAddress(hostIPAddress);if (hostInfo.HostName.EndsWith(\\\"trustme.com\\\")) {trusted = true;}IP addresses are more reliable than DNS names, but they can also be spoofed. Attackers can easily forge the source IP address of the packets they send, but response packets will return to the forged IP address. To see the response packets, the attacker has to sniff the traffic between the victim machine and the forged IP address. In order to accomplish the required sniffing, attackers typically attempt to locate themselves on the same subnet as the victim machine. Attackers may be able to circumvent this requirement by using source routing, but source routing is disabled across much of the Internet today.

Some hash functions perform salting automatically. These functions can significantly increase the overhead for a brute force attack compared to intentionally-fast functions such as MD5. For example, rainbow table attacks can become infeasible due to the high computing overhead. Finally, since computing power gets faster and cheaper over time, the technique can be reconfigured to increase the workload without forcing an entire replacement of the algorithm in use.Some hash functions that have one or more of these desired properties include bcrypt [REF-291], scrypt [REF-292], and PBKDF2 [REF-293]. While there is active debate about which of these is the most effective, they are all stronger than using salts with hash functions with very little computing overhead.Note that using these functions can have an impact on performance, so they require special consideration to avoid denial-of-service attacks. However, their configurability provides finer control over how much CPU and memory is used, so it could be adjusted to suit the environment's needs.Effectiveness: High\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationIf a technique that requires extra computational effort can not be implemented, then for each password that is processed, generate a new random salt using a strong random number generator with unpredictable seeds. Add the salt to the plaintext password before hashing it. When storing the hash, also store the salt. Do not use the same salt for every password.Effectiveness: LimitedNote:Be aware that salts will not reduce the workload of a targeted attack against an individual hash (such as the password for a critical person), and in general they are less effective than other hashing techniques such as increasing the computation time or memory overhead. Without a built-in workload, modern attacks can compute large numbers of hashes, or even exhaust the entire space of all possible passwords, within a very short amount of time, using massively-parallel computing and GPU, ASIC, or FPGA hardware.\",\n    \"Weakness Ordinalities\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Detection Methods\": \"Automated Static AnalysisAutomated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.

For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.

Now, this code is executed any time people view messages.Notice that XSS (CWE-79) is also possible in this situation.Example 2edit-config.pl: This CGI script is used to modify settings in a configuration file.(bad code)Example Language:Perluse CGI qw(:standard);sub config_file_add_key {my ($fname, $key, $arg) = @_;# code to add a field/key to a file goes here}sub config_file_set_key {my ($fname, $key, $arg) = @_;# code to set key to a particular file goes here}sub config_file_delete_key {my ($fname, $key, $arg) = @_;# code to delete key from a particular file goes here}sub handleConfigAction {my ($fname, $action) = @_;my $key = param('key');my $val = param('val');# this is super-efficient code, especially if you have to invoke# any one of dozens of different functions!my $code = \\\"config_file_$action_key(\\\\$fname, \\\\$key, \\\\$val);\\\";eval($code);}$configfile = \\\"/home/cwe/config.txt\\\";print header;if (defined(param('action'))) {handleConfigAction($configfile, param('action'));}else {print \\\"No action specified!\\\\n\\\";}The script intends to take the 'action' parameter and invoke one of a variety of functions based on the value of that parameter - config_file_add_key(), config_file_set_key(), or config_file_delete_key(). It could set up a conditional to invoke each function separately, but eval() is a powerful way of doing the same thing in fewer lines of code, especially when a large number of functions or variables are involved. Unfortunately, in this case, the attacker can provide other values in the action parameter, such as:(attack code)add_key(\\\",\\\",\\\"); system(\\\"/bin/ls\\\");This would produce the following string in handleConfigAction():(result)config_file_add_key(\\\",\\\",\\\"); system(\\\"/bin/ls\\\");Any arbitrary Perl code could be added after the attacker has \\\"closed off\\\" the construction of the original function call, in order to prevent parsing errors from causing the malicious eval() to fail before the attacker's payload is activated. This particular manipulation would fail after the system() call, because the \\\"_key(\\\\$fname, \\\\$key, \\\\$val)\\\" portion of the string would cause an error, but this is irrelevant to the attack because the payload has already been activated.Example 3This simple script asks a user to supply a list of numbers as input and adds them together.(bad code)Example Language:Pythondef main():sum = 0numbers = eval(input(\\\"Enter a space-separated list of numbers: \\\"))for num in numbers:sum = sum + numprint(f\\\"Sum of {numbers} = {sum}\\\")main()The eval() function can take the user-supplied list and convert it into a Python list object, therefore allowing the programmer to use list comprehension methods to work with the data. However, if code is supplied to the eval() function, it will execute that code. For example, a malicious user could supply the following string:(attack code)__import__('subprocess').getoutput('rm -r *')This would delete all the files in the current directory. For this reason, it is not recommended to use eval() with untrusted input.A way to accomplish this without the use of eval() is to apply an integer conversion on the input within a try/except block. If the user-supplied input is not numeric, this will raise a ValueError. By avoiding eval(), there is no opportunity for the input string to be executed as code.(good code)Example Language:Pythondef main():sum = 0numbers = input(\\\"Enter a space-separated list of numbers: \\\").split(\\\" \\\")try:for num in numbers:sum = sum + int(num)print(f\\\"Sum of {numbers} = {sum}\\\")except ValueError:print(\\\"Error: invalid input\\\")main()An alternative, commonly-cited mitigation for this kind of weakness is to use the ast.literal_eval() function, since it is intentionally designed to avoid executing code.

This may effectively restrict which code can be executed by your product.Examples include the Unix chroot jail and AppArmor. In general, managed code may provide some protection.This may not be a feasible solution, and it only limits the impact to the operating system; the rest of your application may still be subject to compromise.Be careful to avoidCWE-243and other weaknesses related to jails.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Input ValidationAssume all input is malicious. Use an \\\"accept known good\\\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \\\"boat\\\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \\\"red\\\" or \\\"blue.\\\"Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.To reduce the likelihood of code injection, use stringent allowlists that limit which constructs are allowed. If you are dynamically constructing code that invokes a function, then verifying that the input is alphanumeric might be insufficient. An attacker might still be able to reference a dangerous function that you did not intend to allow, such as system(), exec(), or exit().\\n\\nPhase:  TestingUse automated static analysis tools that target this type of weakness. Many modern techniques use data flow analysis to minimize the number of false positives. This is not a perfect solution, since 100% accuracy and coverage are not feasible.\\n\\nPhase:  TestingUse dynamic tools and techniques that interact with the product using large test suites with many diverse inputs, such as fuzz testing (fuzzing), robustness testing, and fault injection. The product's operation may slow down, but it should not become unstable, crash, or generate incorrect results.\\n\\nPhase:  OperationStrategy:  Compilation or Build HardeningRun the code in an environment that performs automatic taint propagation and prevents any command execution that uses tainted variables, such as Perl's \\\"-T\\\" switch. This will force the program to perform validation steps that remove the taint, although you must be careful to correctly validate your inputs so that you do not accidentally mark dangerous inputs as untainted (seeCWE-183andCWE-184).\\n\\nPhase:  OperationStrategy:  Environment HardeningRun the code in an environment that performs automatic taint propagation and prevents any command execution that uses tainted variables, such as Perl's \\\"-T\\\" switch.

Use an appropriate combination of denylists and allowlists to ensure only valid, expected and appropriate input is processed by the system.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Input ValidationAssume all input is malicious. Use an \\\"accept known good\\\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \\\"boat\\\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \\\"red\\\" or \\\"blue.\\\"Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Output EncodingWhile it is risky to use dynamically-generated query strings, code, or commands that mix control and data together, sometimes it may be unavoidable. Properly quote arguments and escape any special characters within those arguments. The most conservative approach is to escape or filter all characters that do not pass an extremely strict allowlist (such as everything that is not alphanumeric or white space). If some special characters are still needed, such as white space, wrap each argument in quotes after the escaping/filtering step. Be careful of argument injection (CWE-88).\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Input ValidationInputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180). Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice (CWE-174).

But if an I/O error occurs, fgets() will not null-terminate buf. Furthermore, if the end of the file is reached before any characters are read, fgets() returns without writing anything to buf. In both of these situations, fgets() signals that something unusual has happened by returning NULL, but in this code, the warning will not be noticed. The lack of a null terminator in buf can result in a buffer overflow in the subsequent call to strcpy().Example 2The following code does not check to see if memory allocation succeeded before attempting to use the pointer returned by malloc().(bad code)Example Language:Cbuf = (char*) malloc(req_size);strncpy(buf, xfer, req_size);The traditional defense of this coding error is: \\\"If my program runs out of memory, it will fail. It doesn't matter whether I handle the error or simply allow the program to die with a segmentation fault when it tries to dereference the null pointer.\\\" This argument ignores three important considerations:Depending upon the type and size of the application, it may be possible to free memory that is being used elsewhere so that execution can continue.It is impossible for the program to perform a graceful exit if required. If the program is performing an atomic operation, it can leave the system in an inconsistent state.The programmer has lost the opportunity to record diagnostic information. Did the call to malloc() fail because req_size was too large or because there were too many requests being handled at the same time? Or was it caused by a memory leak that has built up over time? Without handling the error, there is no way to know.Example 3The following examples read a file into a byte array.(bad code)Example Language:C#char[] byteArray = new char[1024];for (IEnumerator i=users.GetEnumerator(); i.MoveNext() ;i.Current()) {String userName = (String) i.Current();String pFileName = PFILE_ROOT + \\\"/\\\" + userName;StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(pFileName);sr.Read(byteArray,0,1024);//the file is always 1k bytessr.Close();processPFile(userName, byteArray);}(bad code)Example Language:JavaFileInputStream fis;byte[] byteArray = new byte[1024];for (Iterator i=users.iterator(); i.hasNext();) {String userName = (String) i.next();String pFileName = PFILE_ROOT + \\\"/\\\" + userName;FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(pFileName);fis.read(byteArray); // the file is always 1k bytesfis.close();processPFile(userName, byteArray);The code loops through a set of users, reading a private data file for each user. The programmer assumes that the files are always 1 kilobyte in size and therefore ignores the return value from Read(). If an attacker can create a smaller file, the program will recycle the remainder of the data from the previous user and treat it as though it belongs to the attacker.Example 4The following code does not check to see if the string returned by getParameter() is null before calling the member function compareTo(), potentially causing a NULL dereference.(bad code)Example Language:JavaString itemName = request.getParameter(ITEM_NAME);if (itemName.compareTo(IMPORTANT_ITEM) == 0) {...}...The following code does not check to see if the string returned by the Item property is null before calling the member function Equals(), potentially causing a NULL dereference.(bad code)Example Language:JavaString itemName = request.Item(ITEM_NAME);if (itemName.Equals(IMPORTANT_ITEM)) {...}...The traditional defense of this coding error is: \\\"I know the requested value will always exist because.... If it does not exist, the program cannot perform the desired behavior so it doesn't matter whether I handle the error or simply allow the program to die dereferencing a null value.\\\" But attackers are skilled at finding unexpected paths through programs, particularly when exceptions are involved.Example 5The following code shows a system property that is set to null and later dereferenced by a programmer who mistakenly assumes it will always be defined.(bad code)Example Language:JavaSystem.clearProperty(\\\"os.name\\\");...String os = System.getProperty(\\\"os.name\\\");if (os.equalsIgnoreCase(\\\"Windows 95\\\")) System.out.println(\\\"Not supported\\\");The traditional defense of this coding error is: \\\"I know the requested value will always exist because.... If it does not exist, the program cannot perform the desired behavior so it doesn't matter whether I handle the error or simply allow the program to die dereferencing a null value.\\\" But attackers are skilled at finding unexpected paths through programs, particularly when exceptions are involved.Example 6The following VB.NET code does not check to make sure that it has read 50 bytes from myfile.txt. This can cause DoDangerousOperation() to operate on an unexpected value.(bad code)Example Language:C#Dim MyFile As New FileStream(\\\"myfile.txt\\\", FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.Read)Dim MyArray(50) As ByteMyFile.Read(MyArray, 0, 50)DoDangerousOperation(MyArray(20))In .NET, it is not uncommon for programmers to misunderstand Read() and related methods that are part of many System.IO classes. The stream and reader classes do not consider it to be unusual or exceptional if only a small amount of data becomes available. These classes simply add the small amount of data to the return buffer, and set the return value to the number of bytes or characters read. There is no guarantee that the amount of data returned is equal to the amount of data requested.Example 7This example takes an IP address from a user, verifies that it is well formed and then looks up the hostname and copies it into a buffer.(bad code)Example Language:Cvoid host_lookup(char *user_supplied_addr){struct hostent *hp;in_addr_t *addr;char hostname[64];in_addr_t inet_addr(const char *cp);/*routine that ensures user_supplied_addr is in the right format for conversion */validate_addr_form(user_supplied_addr);addr = inet_addr(user_supplied_addr);hp = gethostbyaddr( addr, sizeof(struct in_addr), AF_INET);strcpy(hostname, hp->h_name);}If an attacker provides an address that appears to be well-formed, but the address does not resolve to a hostname, then the call to gethostbyaddr() will return NULL. Since the code does not check the return value from gethostbyaddr (CWE-252), a NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476) would then occur in the call to strcpy().Note that this code is also vulnerable to a buffer overflow (CWE-119).Example 8In the following C/C++ example the method outputStringToFile opens a file in the local filesystem and outputs a string to the file. The input parameters output and filename contain the string to output to the file and the name of the file respectively.(bad code)Example Language:C++int outputStringToFile(char *output, char *filename) {openFileToWrite(filename);writeToFile(output);closeFile(filename);}However, this code does not check the return values of the methods openFileToWrite, writeToFile, closeFile to verify that the file was properly opened and closed and that the string was successfully written to the file. The return values for these methods should be checked to determine if the method was successful and allow for detection of errors or unexpected conditions as in the following example.(good code)Example Language:C++int outputStringToFile(char *output, char *filename) {int isOutput = SUCCESS;int isOpen = openFileToWrite(filename);if (isOpen == FAIL) {printf(\\\"Unable to open file %s\\\", filename);isOutput = FAIL;}else {int isWrite = writeToFile(output);if (isWrite == FAIL) {printf(\\\"Unable to write to file %s\\\", filename);isOutput = FAIL;}int isClose = closeFile(filename);if (isClose == FAIL)isOutput = FAIL;}return isOutput;}Example 9In the following Java example the method readFromFile uses a FileReader object to read the contents of a file. The FileReader object is created using the File object readFile, the readFile object is initialized using the setInputFile method. The setInputFile method should be called before calling the readFromFile method.(bad code)Example Language:Javaprivate File readFile = null;public void setInputFile(String inputFile) {// create readFile File object from string containing name of file}public void readFromFile() {try {reader = new FileReader(readFile);// read input file} catch (FileNotFoundException ex) {...}}However, the readFromFile method does not check to see if the readFile object is null, i.e. has not been initialized, before creating the FileReader object and reading from the input file. The readFromFile method should verify whether the readFile object is null and output an error message and raise an exception if the readFile object is null, as in the following code.(good code)Example Language:Javaprivate File readFile = null;public void setInputFile(String inputFile) {// create readFile File object from string containing name of file}public void readFromFile() {try {if (readFile == null) {System.err.println(\\\"Input file has not been set, call setInputFile method before calling openInputFile\\\");throw NullPointerException;}reader = new FileReader(readFile);// read input file} catch (FileNotFoundException ex) {...}catch (NullPointerException ex) {...}}\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2023-49286Chain: function in web caching proxy does not correctly check a return value (CWE-253) leading to a reachable assertion (CWE-617)CVE-2007-3798Unchecked return value leads to resultant integer overflow and code execution.CVE-2006-4447Program does not check return value when invoking functions to drop privileges, which could leave users with higher privileges than expected by forcing those functions to fail.CVE-2006-2916Program does not check return value when invoking functions to drop privileges, which could leave users with higher privileges than expected by forcing those functions to fail.\",\n    \"References\": \"[REF-62] Mark Dowd, John McDonald\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand Justin Schuh. \\\"The Art of Software Security Assessment\\\".

Custom exceptions may need to be developed to handle unusual business-logic conditions. Be careful not to pass sensitive exceptions back to the user (CWE-209,CWE-248).\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationCheck the results of all functions that return a value and verify that the value is expected.Effectiveness: HighNote:Checking the return value of the function will typically be sufficient, however beware of race conditions (CWE-362) in a concurrent environment.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationIf using exception handling, catch and throw specific exceptions instead of overly-general exceptions (CWE-396,CWE-397). Catch and handle exceptions as locally as possible so that exceptions do not propagate too far up the call stack (CWE-705). Avoid unchecked or uncaught exceptions where feasible (CWE-248).Effectiveness: HighNote:Using specific exceptions, and ensuring that exceptions are checked, helps programmers to anticipate and appropriately handle many unusual events that could occur.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationEnsure that error messages only contain minimal details that are useful to the intended audience and no one else. The messages need to strike the balance between being too cryptic (which can confuse users) or being too detailed (which may reveal more than intended). The messages should not reveal the methods that were used to determine the error. Attackers can use detailed information to refine or optimize their original attack, thereby increasing their chances of success.If errors must be captured in some detail, record them in log messages, but consider what could occur if the log messages can be viewed by attackers. Highly sensitive information such as passwords should never be saved to log files.Avoid inconsistent messaging that might accidentally tip off an attacker about internal state, such as whether a user account exists or not.Exposing additional information to a potential attacker in the context of an exceptional condition can help the attacker determine what attack vectors are most likely to succeed beyond DoS.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Input ValidationAssume all input is malicious. Use an \\\"accept known good\\\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \\\"boat\\\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \\\"red\\\" or \\\"blue.\\\"Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.Note:Performing extensive input validation does not help with handling unusual conditions, but it will minimize their occurrences and will make it more difficult for attackers to trigger them.\\n\\nPhases:  Architecture and Design; ImplementationIf the program must fail, ensure that it fails gracefully (fails closed). There may be a temptation to simply let the program fail poorly in cases such as low memory conditions, but an attacker may be able to assert control before the software has fully exited. Alternately, an uncontrolled failure could cause cascading problems with other downstream components; for example, the program could send a signal to a downstream process so the process immediately knows that a problem has occurred and has a better chance of recovery.\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignUse system limits, which should help to prevent resource exhaustion.

This is usually outside the scope of a program's implicit security policy.\",\n    \"Likelihood of Exploit\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Demonstrative Examples\": \"Example 1The following code allocates memory for a maximum number of widgets. It then gets a user-specified number of widgets, making sure that the user does not request too many. It then initializes the elements of the array using InitializeWidget(). Because the number of widgets can vary for each request, the code inserts a NULL pointer to signify the location of the last widget.(bad code)Example Language:Cint i;unsigned int numWidgets;Widget **WidgetList;numWidgets = GetUntrustedSizeValue();if ((numWidgets == 0) || (numWidgets > MAX_NUM_WIDGETS)) {ExitError(\\\"Incorrect number of widgets requested!\\\");}WidgetList = (Widget **)malloc(numWidgets * sizeof(Widget *));printf(\\\"WidgetList ptr=%p\\\\n\\\", WidgetList);for(i=0; i<numWidgets; i++) {WidgetList[i] = InitializeWidget();}WidgetList[numWidgets] = NULL;showWidgets(WidgetList);However, this code contains an off-by-one calculation error (CWE-193). It allocates exactly enough space to contain the specified number of widgets, but it does not include the space for the NULL pointer. As a result, the allocated buffer is smaller than it is supposed to be (CWE-131). So if the user ever requests MAX_NUM_WIDGETS, there is an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) when the NULL is assigned. Depending on the environment and compilation settings, this could cause memory corruption.Example 2In this example, the code does not account for the terminating null character, and it writes one byte beyond the end of the buffer.The first call to strncat() appends up to 20 characters plus a terminating null character to fullname[]. There is plenty of allocated space for this, and there is no weakness associated with this first call. However, the second call to strncat() potentially appends another 20 characters. The code does not account for the terminating null character that is automatically added by strncat(). This terminating null character would be written one byte beyond the end of the fullname[] buffer. Therefore an off-by-one error exists with the second strncat() call, as the third argument should be 19.(bad code)Example Language:Cchar firstname[20];char lastname[20];char fullname[40];fullname[0] = '\\\\0';strncat(fullname, firstname, 20);strncat(fullname, lastname, 20);When using a function like strncat() one must leave a free byte at the end of the buffer for a terminating null character, thus avoiding the off-by-one weakness. Additionally, the last argument to strncat() is the number of characters to append, which must be less than the remaining space in the buffer. Be careful not to just use the total size of the buffer.(good code)Example Language:Cchar firstname[20];char lastname[20];char fullname[40];fullname[0] = '\\\\0';strncat(fullname, firstname, sizeof(fullname)-strlen(fullname)-1);strncat(fullname, lastname, sizeof(fullname)-strlen(fullname)-1);Example 3The Off-by-one error can also be manifested when reading characters from a character array within a for loop that has an incorrect continuation condition.(bad code)Example Language:C#define PATH_SIZE 60char filename[PATH_SIZE];for(i=0; i<=PATH_SIZE; i++) {char c = getc();if (c == 'EOF') {filename[i] = '\\\\0';}filename[i] = getc();}In this case, the correct continuation condition is shown below.(good code)Example Language:Cfor(i=0; i<PATH_SIZE; i++) {...Example 4As another example the Off-by-one error can occur when using the sprintf library function to copy a string variable to a formatted string variable and the original string variable comes from an untrusted source. As in the following example where a local function, setFilename is used to store the value of a filename to a database but first uses sprintf to format the filename. The setFilename function includes an input parameter with the name of the file that is used as the copy source in the sprintf function. The sprintf function will copy the file name to a char array of size 20 and specifies the format of the new variable as 16 characters followed by the file extension .dat.(bad code)Example Language:Cint setFilename(char *filename) {char name[20];sprintf(name, \\\"%16s.dat\\\", filename);int success = saveFormattedFilenameToDB(name);return success;}However this will cause an Off-by-one error if the original filename is exactly 16 characters or larger because the format of 16 characters with the file extension is exactly 20 characters and does not take into account the required null terminator that will be placed at the end of the string.\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2003-0252Off-by-one error allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via requests that do not contain newlines.CVE-2001-1391Off-by-one vulnerability in driver allows users to modify kernel memory.CVE-2002-0083Off-by-one error allows local users or remote malicious servers to gain privileges.CVE-2002-0653Off-by-one buffer overflow in function usd by server allows local users to execute arbitrary code as the server user via .htaccess files with long entries.CVE-2002-0844Off-by-one buffer overflow in version control system allows local users to execute arbitrary code.CVE-1999-1568Off-by-one error in FTP server allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service (crash) via a long PORT command.CVE-2004-0346Off-by-one buffer overflow in FTP server allows local users to gain privileges via a 1024 byte RETR command.CVE-2004-0005Multiple buffer overflows in chat client allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code.CVE-2003-0356Multiple off-by-one vulnerabilities in product allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code.CVE-2001-1496Off-by-one buffer overflow in server allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code.CVE-2004-0342This is an interesting example that might not be an off-by-one.CVE-2001-0609An off-by-one enables a terminating null to be overwritten, which causes 2 strings to be merged and enable a format string.CVE-2002-1745Off-by-one error allows source code disclosure of files with 4 letter extensions that match an accepted 3-letter extension.CVE-2002-1816Off-by-one buffer overflow.CVE-2002-1721Off-by-one error causes an snprintf call to overwrite a critical internal variable with a null value.CVE-2003-0466Off-by-one error in function used in many products leads to a buffer overflow during pathname management, as demonstrated using multiple commands in an FTP server.CVE-2003-0625Off-by-one error allows read of sensitive memory via a malformed request.CVE-2006-4574Chain: security monitoring product has an off-by-one error that leads to unexpected length values, triggering an assertion.\",\n    \"References\": \"[REF-155] Halvar Flake. \\\"Third Generation Exploits\\\". presentation at Black Hat Europe 2001. <https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.blackhat.com%2Fpresentations%2Fbh-europe-01%2Fhalvar-flake%2Fbh-europe-01-halvarflake.ppt&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK>.URL validated: 2023-04-07.[REF-156] Steve Christey. \\\"Off-by-one errors: a brief explanation\\\".

An attacker could provide an input path of \\\"/safe_dir/../\\\" that would pass the validation step. However, the canonicalization process sees the double dot as a traversal to the parent directory and hence when canonicized the path would become just \\\"/\\\".To avoid this problem, validation should occur after canonicalization takes place. In this case canonicalization occurs during the initialization of the File object. The code below fixes the issue.(good code)Example Language:JavaString path = getInputPath();File f = new File(path);if (f.getCanonicalPath().startsWith(\\\"/safe_dir/\\\")){return f.getCanonicalPath();}Example 2This function prints the contents of a specified file requested by a user.(bad code)Example Language:PHPfunction printFile($username,$filename){//read file into string$file = file_get_contents($filename);if ($file && isOwnerOf($username,$filename)){echo $file;return true;}else{echo 'You are not authorized to view this file';}return false;}This code first reads a specified file into memory, then prints the file if the user is authorized to see its contents. The read of the file into memory may be resource intensive and is unnecessary if the user is not allowed to see the file anyway.Example 3Assume that the module foo_bar implements a protected register. The register content is the asset. Only transactions made by user id (indicated by signal usr_id) 0x4 are allowed to modify the register contents. The signal grant_access is used to provide access.(bad code)Example Language:Verilogmodule foo_bar(data_out, usr_id, data_in, clk, rst_n);output reg [7:0] data_out;input wire [2:0] usr_id;input wire [7:0] data_in;input wire clk, rst_n;wire grant_access;always @ (posedge clk or negedge rst_n)beginif (!rst_n)data_out = 0;elsedata_out = (grant_access) ? data_in : data_out;assign grant_access = (usr_id == 3'h4) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0;endendmoduleThis code uses Verilog blocking assignments for data_out and grant_access. Therefore, these assignments happen sequentially (i.e., data_out is updated to new value first, and grant_access is updated the next cycle) and not in parallel. Therefore, the asset data_out is allowed to be modified even before the access control check is complete and grant_access signal is set. Since grant_access does not have a reset value, it will be meta-stable and will randomly go to either 0 or 1.Flipping the order of the assignment of data_out and grant_access should solve the problem. The correct snippet of code is shown below.(good code)Example Language:Verilogalways @ (posedge clk or negedge rst_n)beginif (!rst_n)data_out = 0;elseassign grant_access = (usr_id == 3'h4) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0;data_out = (grant_access) ? data_in : data_out;endendmodule\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2019-9805Chain: Creation of the packet client occurs before initialization is complete (CWE-696) resulting in a read from uninitialized memory (CWE-908), causing memory corruption.CVE-2007-5191file-system management programs call the setuid and setgid functions in the wrong order and do not check the return values, allowing attackers to gain unintended privilegesCVE-2007-1588C++ web server program calls Process::setuid before calling Process::setgid, preventing it from dropping privileges, potentially allowing CGI programs to be called with higher privileges than intendedCVE-2022-37734Chain: lexer in Java-based GraphQL server does not enforce maximum of tokens early enough (CWE-696), allowing excessive CPU consumption (CWE-1176)\",\n    \"References\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Content History\": \"SubmissionsSubmission DateSubmitterOrganization2008-09-09(CWE 1.0, 2008-09-09)CWE Content TeamMITREModificationsModification DateModifierOrganization2008-11-24CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Relationships, Taxonomy_Mappings2009-05-27CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Description2011-03-29CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Relationships2011-06-01CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Common_Consequences2011-06-27CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Common_Consequences2012-05-11CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Related_Attack_Patterns, Relationships, Weakness_Ordinalities2014-07-30CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Relationships2017-05-03CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Observed_Examples2017-11-08CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Taxonomy_Mappings2019-01-03CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Relationships2020-02-24CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Relationships2020-06-25CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Description, Observed_Examples, Relationships2021-03-15CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Observed_Examples2023-04-27CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Relationships2023-06-29CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Mapping_Notes2023-10-26CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Demonstrative_Examples, Observed_Examples2024-02-29(CWE 4.14, 2024-02-29)CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Demonstrative_Examples\",\n    \"Previous Entry Names\": \"N/A\"\n}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n    \"Potential Mitigations\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Weakness Ordinalities\": \"OrdinalityDescriptionPrimary(where the weakness exists independent of other weaknesses)\",\n    \"Detection Methods\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Functional Areas\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Affected Resources\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Memberships\": \"NatureTypeIDNameMemberOf748CERT C Secure Coding Standard (2008) Appendix - POSIX (POS)MemberOf977SFP Secondary Cluster: DesignMemberOf1171SEI CERT C Coding Standard - Guidelines 50.

Use an appropriate combination of denylists and allowlists to ensure only valid, expected and appropriate input is processed by the system.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Input ValidationAssume all input is malicious. Use an \\\"accept known good\\\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \\\"boat\\\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \\\"red\\\" or \\\"blue.\\\"Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Output EncodingWhile it is risky to use dynamically-generated query strings, code, or commands that mix control and data together, sometimes it may be unavoidable. Properly quote arguments and escape any special characters within those arguments. The most conservative approach is to escape or filter all characters that do not pass an extremely strict allowlist (such as everything that is not alphanumeric or white space). If some special characters are still needed, such as white space, wrap each argument in quotes after the escaping/filtering step. Be careful of argument injection (CWE-88).\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Input ValidationInputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180).

All files are stored in a single directory.(bad code)Example Language:Perlmy $dataPath = \\\"/users/cwe/profiles\\\";my $username = param(\\\"user\\\");my $profilePath = $dataPath . \\\"/\\\" . $username;open(my $fh, \\\"<\\\", $profilePath) || ExitError(\\\"profile read error: $profilePath\\\");print \\\"<ul>\\\\n\\\";while (<$fh>) {print \\\"<li>$_</li>\\\\n\\\";}print \\\"</ul>\\\\n\\\";While the programmer intends to access files such as \\\"/users/cwe/profiles/alice\\\" or \\\"/users/cwe/profiles/bob\\\", there is no verification of the incoming user parameter. An attacker could provide a string such as:(attack code)../../../etc/passwdThe program would generate a profile pathname like this:(result)/users/cwe/profiles/../../../etc/passwdWhen the file is opened, the operating system resolves the \\\"../\\\" during path canonicalization and actually accesses this file:(result)/etc/passwdAs a result, the attacker could read the entire text of the password file.Notice how this code also contains an error message information leak (CWE-209) if the user parameter does not produce a file that exists: the full pathname is provided. Because of the lack of output encoding of the file that is retrieved, there might also be a cross-site scripting problem (CWE-79) if profile contains any HTML, but other code would need to be examined.Example 2In the example below, the path to a dictionary file is read from a system property and used to initialize a File object.(bad code)Example Language:JavaString filename = System.getProperty(\\\"com.domain.application.dictionaryFile\\\");File dictionaryFile = new File(filename);However, the path is not validated or modified to prevent it from containing relative or absolute path sequences before creating the File object. This allows anyone who can control the system property to determine what file is used. Ideally, the path should be resolved relative to some kind of application or user home directory.Example 3The following code takes untrusted input and uses a regular expression to filter \\\"../\\\" from the input. It then appends this result to the /home/user/ directory and attempts to read the file in the final resulting path.(bad code)Example Language:Perlmy $Username = GetUntrustedInput();$Username =~ s/\\\\.\\\\.\\\\///;my $filename = \\\"/home/user/\\\" . $Username;ReadAndSendFile($filename);Since the regular expression does not have the /g global match modifier, it only removes the first instance of \\\"../\\\" it comes across. So an input value such as:(attack code)../../../etc/passwdwill have the first \\\"../\\\" stripped, resulting in:(result)../../etc/passwdThis value is then concatenated with the /home/user/ directory:(result)/home/user/../../etc/passwdwhich causes the /etc/passwd file to be retrieved once the operating system has resolved the ../ sequences in the pathname. This leads to relative path traversal (CWE-23).Example 4The following code attempts to validate a given input path by checking it against an allowlist and once validated delete the given file. In this specific case, the path is considered valid if it starts with the string \\\"/safe_dir/\\\".(bad code)Example Language:JavaString path = getInputPath();if (path.startsWith(\\\"/safe_dir/\\\")){File f = new File(path);f.delete()}An attacker could provide an input such as this:(attack code)/safe_dir/../important.datThe software assumes that the path is valid because it starts with the \\\"/safe_path/\\\" sequence, but the \\\"../\\\" sequence will cause the program to delete the important.dat file in the parent directoryExample 5The following code demonstrates the unrestricted upload of a file with a Java servlet and a path traversal vulnerability. The action attribute of an HTML form is sending the upload file request to the Java servlet.(good code)Example Language:HTML<form action=\\\"FileUploadServlet\\\" method=\\\"post\\\" enctype=\\\"multipart/form-data\\\">Choose a file to upload:<input type=\\\"file\\\" name=\\\"filename\\\"/><br/><input type=\\\"submit\\\" name=\\\"submit\\\" value=\\\"Submit\\\"/></form>When submitted the Java servlet's doPost method will receive the request, extract the name of the file from the Http request header, read the file contents from the request and output the file to the local upload directory.(bad code)Example Language:Javapublic class FileUploadServlet extends HttpServlet {...protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {response.setContentType(\\\"text/html\\\");PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();String contentType = request.getContentType();// the starting position of the boundary headerint ind = contentType.indexOf(\\\"boundary=\\\");String boundary = contentType.substring(ind+9);String pLine = new String();String uploadLocation = new String(UPLOAD_DIRECTORY_STRING); //Constant value// verify that content type is multipart form dataif (contentType != null && contentType.indexOf(\\\"multipart/form-data\\\") != -1) {// extract the filename from the Http headerBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(request.getInputStream()));...pLine = br.readLine();String filename = pLine.substring(pLine.lastIndexOf(\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\"), pLine.lastIndexOf(\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\"));...// output the file to the local upload directorytry {BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(uploadLocation+filename, true));for (String line; (line=br.readLine())!=null; ) {if (line.indexOf(boundary) == -1) {bw.write(line);bw.newLine();bw.flush();}} //end of for loopbw.close();} catch (IOException ex) {...}// output successful upload response HTML page}// output unsuccessful upload response HTML pageelse{...}}...}This code does not perform a check on the type of the file being uploaded (CWE-434). This could allow an attacker to upload any executable file or other file with malicious code.Additionally, the creation of the BufferedWriter object is subject to relative path traversal (CWE-23). Since the code does not check the filename that is provided in the header, an attacker can use \\\"../\\\" sequences to write to files outside of the intended directory. Depending on the executing environment, the attacker may be able to specify arbitrary files to write to, leading to a wide variety of consequences, from code execution, XSS (CWE-79), or system crash.Example 6This script intends to read a user-supplied file from the current directory. The user inputs the relative path to the file and the script uses Python's os.path.join() function to combine the path to the current working directory with the provided path to the specified file. This results in an absolute path to the desired file. If the file does not exist when the script attempts to read it, an error is printed to the user.(bad code)Example Language:Pythonimport osimport sysdef main():filename = sys.argv[1]path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), filename)try:with open(path, 'r') as f:file_data = f.read()except FileNotFoundError as e:print(\\\"Error - file not found\\\")main()However, if the user supplies an absolute path, the os.path.join() function will discard the path to the current working directory and use only the absolute path provided. For example, if the current working directory is /home/user/documents, but the user inputs /etc/passwd, os.path.join() will use only /etc/passwd, as it is considered an absolute path. In the above scenario, this would cause the script to access and read the /etc/passwd file.(good code)Example Language:Pythonimport osimport sysdef main():filename = sys.argv[1]path = os.path.normpath(f\\\"{os.getcwd()}{os.sep}{filename}\\\")try:with open(path, 'r') as f:file_data = f.read()except FileNotFoundError as e:print(\\\"Error - file not found\\\")main()The constructed path string uses os.sep to add the appropriate separation character for the given operating system (e.g. '\\\\' or '/') and the call to os.path.normpath() removes any additional slashes that may have been entered - this may occur particularly when using a Windows path. By putting the pieces of the path string together in this fashion, the script avoids a call to os.path.join() and any potential issues that might arise if an absolute path is entered. With this version of the script, if the current working directory is /home/user/documents, and the user inputs /etc/passwd, the resulting path will be /home/user/documents/etc/passwd. The user is therefore contained within the current working directory as intended.\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2022-45918Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \\\"../\\\" sequences (CWE-24)CVE-2019-20916Python package manager does not correctly restrict the filename specified in a Content-Disposition header, allowing arbitrary file read using path traversal sequences such as \\\"../\\\"CVE-2022-31503Python package constructs filenames using an unsafe os.path.join call on untrusted input, allowing absolute path traversal because os.path.join resets the pathname to an absolute path that is specified as part of the input.CVE-2022-24877directory traversal in Go-based Kubernetes operator app allows accessing data from the controller's pod file system via ../ sequences in a yaml fileCVE-2021-21972Chain: Cloud computing virtualization platform does not require authentication for upload of a tar format file (CWE-306), then uses .. path traversal sequences (CWE-23) in the file to access unexpected files, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.CVE-2020-4053a Kubernetes package manager written in Go allows malicious plugins to inject path traversal sequences into a plugin archive (\\\"Zip slip\\\") to copy a file outside the intended directoryCVE-2020-3452Chain: security product has improper input validation (CWE-20) leading to directory traversal (CWE-22), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.CVE-2019-10743Go-based archive library allows extraction of files to locations outside of the target folder with \\\"../\\\" path traversal sequences in filenames in a zip file, aka \\\"Zip Slip\\\"CVE-2010-0467Newsletter module allows reading arbitrary files using \\\"../\\\" sequences.CVE-2006-7079Chain: PHP app uses extract for register_globals compatibility layer (CWE-621), enabling path traversal (CWE-22)CVE-2009-4194FTP server allows deletion of arbitrary files using \\\"..\\\" in the DELE command.CVE-2009-4053FTP server allows creation of arbitrary directories using \\\"..\\\" in the MKD command.CVE-2009-0244FTP service for a Bluetooth device allows listing of directories, and creation or reading of files using \\\"..\\\" sequences.CVE-2009-4013Software package maintenance program allows overwriting arbitrary files using \\\"../\\\" sequences.CVE-2009-4449Bulletin board allows attackers to determine the existence of files using the avatar.CVE-2009-4581PHP program allows arbitrary code execution using \\\"..\\\" in filenames that are fed to the include() function.CVE-2010-0012Overwrite of files using a .. in a Torrent file.CVE-2010-0013Chat program allows overwriting files using a custom smiley request.CVE-2008-5748Chain: external control of values for user's desired language and theme enables path traversal.CVE-2009-1936Chain: library file sends a redirect if it is directly requested but continues to execute, allowing remote file inclusion and path traversal.\",\n    \"References\": \"[REF-7] Michael Howard and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDavid LeBlanc. \\\"Writing Secure Code\\\".

Use an \\\"accept known good\\\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \\\"boat\\\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \\\"red\\\" or \\\"blue.\\\"Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.When validating filenames, use stringent allowlists that limit the character set to be used. If feasible, only allow a single \\\".\\\" character in the filename to avoid weaknesses such asCWE-23, and exclude directory separators such as \\\"/\\\" to avoidCWE-36. Use a list of allowable file extensions, which will help to avoidCWE-434.Do not rely exclusively on a filtering mechanism that removes potentially dangerous characters. This is equivalent to a denylist, which may be incomplete (CWE-184). For example, filtering \\\"/\\\" is insufficient protection if the filesystem also supports the use of \\\"\\\\\\\" as a directory separator. Another possible error could occur when the filtering is applied in a way that still produces dangerous data (CWE-182). For example, if \\\"../\\\" sequences are removed from the \\\".../...//\\\" string in a sequential fashion, two instances of \\\"../\\\" would be removed from the original string, but the remaining characters would still form the \\\"../\\\" string.\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignFor any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoidCWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Input ValidationInputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180). Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice (CWE-174). Such errors could be used to bypass allowlist validation schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked.Use a built-in path canonicalization function (such as realpath() in C) that produces the canonical version of the pathname, which effectively removes \\\"..\\\" sequences and symbolic links (CWE-23,CWE-59). This includes:realpath() in CgetCanonicalPath() in JavaGetFullPath() in ASP.NETrealpath() or abs_path() in Perlrealpath() in PHP\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignStrategy:  Libraries or FrameworksUse a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.\\n\\nPhase:  OperationStrategy:  FirewallUse an application firewall that can detect attacks against this weakness. It can be beneficial in cases in which the code cannot be fixed (because it is controlled by a third party), as an emergency prevention measure while more comprehensive software assurance measures are applied, or to provide defense in depth.Effectiveness: ModerateNote:An application firewall might not cover all possible input vectors. In addition, attack techniques might be available to bypass the protection mechanism, such as using malformed inputs that can still be processed by the component that receives those inputs. Depending on functionality, an application firewall might inadvertently reject or modify legitimate requests. Finally, some manual effort may be required for customization.\\n\\nPhases:  Architecture and Design; OperationStrategy:  Environment HardeningRun your code using the lowest privileges that are required to accomplish the necessary tasks [REF-76]. If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a single task. That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignStrategy:  Enforcement by ConversionWhen the set of acceptable objects, such as filenames or URLs, is limited or known, create a mapping from a set of fixed input values (such as numeric IDs) to the actual filenames or URLs, and reject all other inputs.For example, ID 1 could map to \\\"inbox.txt\\\" and ID 2 could map to \\\"profile.txt\\\". Features such as the ESAPI AccessReferenceMap [REF-185] provide this capability.\\n\\nPhases:  Architecture and Design; OperationStrategy:  Sandbox or JailRun the code in a \\\"jail\\\" or similar sandbox environment that enforces strict boundaries between the process and the operating system. This may effectively restrict which files can be accessed in a particular directory or which commands can be executed by the software.OS-level examples include the Unix chroot jail, AppArmor, and SELinux. In general, managed code may provide some protection. For example, java.io.FilePermission in the Java SecurityManager allows the software to specify restrictions on file operations.This may not be a feasible solution, and it only limits the impact to the operating system; the rest of the application may still be subject to compromise.Be careful to avoidCWE-243and other weaknesses related to jails.Effectiveness: LimitedNote:The effectiveness of this mitigation depends on the prevention capabilities of the specific sandbox or jail being used and might only help to reduce the scope of an attack, such as restricting the attacker to certain system calls or limiting the portion of the file system that can be accessed.\\n\\nPhases:  Architecture and Design; OperationStrategy:  Attack Surface ReductionStore library, include, and utility files outside of the web document root, if possible. Otherwise, store them in a separate directory and use the web server's access control capabilities to prevent attackers from directly requesting them. One common practice is to define a fixed constant in each calling program, then check for the existence of the constant in the library/include file; if the constant does not exist, then the file was directly requested, and it can exit immediately.This significantly reduces the chance of an attacker being able to bypass any protection mechanisms that are in the base program but not in the include files. It will also reduce the attack surface.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationEnsure that error messages only contain minimal details that are useful to the intended audience and no one else. The messages need to strike the balance between being too cryptic (which can confuse users) or being too detailed (which may reveal more than intended). The messages should not reveal the methods that were used to determine the error. Attackers can use detailed information to refine or optimize their original attack, thereby increasing their chances of success.If errors must be captured in some detail, record them in log messages, but consider what could occur if the log messages can be viewed by attackers. Highly sensitive information such as passwords should never be saved to log files.Avoid inconsistent messaging that might accidentally tip off an attacker about internal state, such as whether a user account exists or not.In the context of path traversal, error messages which disclose path information can help attackers craft the appropriate attack strings to move through the file system hierarchy.\\n\\nPhases:  Operation; ImplementationStrategy:  Environment HardeningWhen using PHP, configure the application so that it does not use register_globals. During implementation, develop the application so that it does not rely on this feature, but be wary of implementing a register_globals emulation that is subject to weaknesses such asCWE-95,CWE-621, and similar issues.\",\n    \"Weakness Ordinalities\": \"OrdinalityDescriptionPrimary(where the weakness exists independent of other weaknesses)Resultant(where the weakness is typically related to the presence of some other weaknesses)\",\n    \"Detection Methods\": \"Automated Static AnalysisAutomated techniques can find areas where path traversal weaknesses exist.

When the software is running in a different environment, the permissions become a problem.\\n\\nInstallationThe developer may set loose permissions in order to minimize problems when the user first runs the program, then create documentation stating that permissions should be tightened. Since system administrators and users do not always read the documentation, this can result in insecure permissions being left unchanged.\\n\\nOperation\",\n    \"Applicable Platforms\": \"Languages\\n\\nClass: Not Language-Specific(Undetermined Prevalence)\\n\\nTechnologies\\n\\nClass: Not Technology-Specific(Undetermined Prevalence)\\n\\nClass: Cloud Computing(Often Prevalent)\",\n    \"Common Consequences\": \"ScopeImpactLikelihood\\n\\nConfidentialityTechnical Impact:Read Application Data; Read Files or DirectoriesAn attacker may be able to read sensitive information from the associated resource, such as credentials or configuration information stored in a file.\\n\\nAccess ControlTechnical Impact:Gain Privileges or Assume IdentityAn attacker may be able to modify critical properties of the associated resource to gain privileges, such as replacing a world-writable executable with a Trojan horse.\\n\\nIntegrityOtherTechnical Impact:Modify Application Data; OtherAn attacker may be able to destroy or corrupt critical data in the associated resource, such as deletion of records from a database.\",\n    \"Likelihood of Exploit\": \"High\",\n    \"Demonstrative Examples\": \"Example 1The following code sets the umask of the process to 0 before creating a file and writing \\\"Hello world\\\" into the file.(bad code)Example Language:C#define OUTFILE \\\"hello.out\\\"umask(0);FILE *out;/* Ignore link following (CWE-59) for brevity */out = fopen(OUTFILE, \\\"w\\\");if (out) {fprintf(out, \\\"hello world!\\\\n\\\");fclose(out);}After running this program on a UNIX system, running the \\\"ls -l\\\" command might return the following output:(result)-rw-rw-rw- 1 username 13 Nov 24 17:58 hello.outThe \\\"rw-rw-rw-\\\" string indicates that the owner, group, and world (all users) can read the file and write to it.Example 2This code creates a home directory for a new user, and makes that user the owner of the directory. If the new directory cannot be owned by the user, the directory is deleted.(bad code)Example Language:PHPfunction createUserDir($username){$path = '/home/'.$username;if(!mkdir($path)){return false;}if(!chown($path,$username)){rmdir($path);return false;}return true;}Because the optional \\\"mode\\\" argument is omitted from the call to mkdir(), the directory is created with the default permissions 0777. Simply setting the new user as the owner of the directory does not explicitly change the permissions of the directory, leaving it with the default. This default allows any user to read and write to the directory, allowing an attack on the user's files. The code also fails to change the owner group of the directory, which may result in access by unexpected groups.This code may also be vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) attacks if an attacker supplies a non alphanumeric username.Example 3The following code snippet might be used as a monitor to periodically record whether a web site is alive. To ensure that the file can always be modified, the code uses chmod() to make the file world-writable.(bad code)Example Language:Perl$fileName = \\\"secretFile.out\\\";if (-e $fileName) {chmod 0777, $fileName;}my $outFH;if (! open($outFH, \\\">>$fileName\\\")) {ExitError(\\\"Couldn't append to $fileName: $!\\\");}my $dateString = FormatCurrentTime();my $status = IsHostAlive(\\\"cwe.mitre.org\\\");print $outFH \\\"$dateString cwe status: $status!\\\\n\\\";close($outFH);The first time the program runs, it might create a new file that inherits the permissions from its environment. A file listing might look like:(result)-rw-r--r-- 1 username 13 Nov 24 17:58 secretFile.outThis listing might occur when the user has a default umask of 022, which is a common setting. Depending on the nature of the file, the user might not have intended to make it readable by everyone on the system.The next time the program runs, however - and all subsequent executions - the chmod will set the file's permissions so that the owner, group, and world (all users) can read the file and write to it:(result)-rw-rw-rw- 1 username 13 Nov 24 17:58 secretFile.outPerhaps the programmer tried to do this because a different process uses different permissions that might prevent the file from being updated.Example 4This program creates and reads from an admin file to determine privilege information.If the admin file doesn't exist, the program will create one. In order to create the file, the program must have write privileges to write to the file. After the file is created, the permissions need to be changed to read only.(bad code)Example Language:Goconst adminFile = \\\"/etc/admin-users\\\"func createAdminFileIfNotExists() error {file, err := os.Create(adminFile)if err != nil {return err}return nil}func changeModeOfAdminFile() error {fileMode := os.FileMode(0440)if err := os.Chmod(adminFile, fileMode); err != nil {return err}return nil}os.Create will create a file with 0666 permissions before umask if the specified file does not exist. A typical umask of 0022 would result in the file having 0644 permissions. That is, the file would have world-writable and world-readable permissions.In this scenario, it is advised to use the more customizable method of os.OpenFile with the os.O_WRONLY and os.O_CREATE flags specifying 0640 permissions to create the admin file.This is because on a typical system where the umask is 0022, the perm 0640 applied in os.OpenFile will result in a file of 0620 where only the owner and group can write.Example 5The following command recursively sets world-readable permissions for a directory and all of its children:(bad code)Example Language:Shellchmod -R ugo+r DIRNAMEIf this command is run from a program, the person calling the program might not expect that all the files under the directory will be world-readable. If the directory is expected to contain private data, this could become a security problem.Example 6The following Azure command updates the settings for a storage account:(bad code)Example Language:Shellaz storage account update --name <storage-account> --resource-group <resource-group> --allow-blob-public-access trueHowever, \\\"Allow Blob Public Access\\\" is set to true, meaning that anonymous/public users can access blobs.The command could be modified to disable \\\"Allow Blob Public Access\\\" by setting it to false.(good code)Example Language:Shellaz storage account update --name <storage-account> --resource-group <resource-group> --allow-blob-public-access falseExample 7The following Google Cloud Storage command gets the settings for a storage account named 'BUCKET_NAME':(informative)Example Language:Shellgsutil iam get gs://BUCKET_NAMESuppose the command returns the following result:(bad code)Example Language:JSON{\\\"bindings\\\":[{\\\"members\\\":[\\\"projectEditor: PROJECT-ID\\\",\\\"projectOwner: PROJECT-ID\\\"],\\\"role\\\":\\\"roles/storage.legacyBucketOwner\\\"},{\\\"members\\\":[\\\"allUsers\\\",\\\"projectViewer: PROJECT-ID\\\"],\\\"role\\\":\\\"roles/storage.legacyBucketReader\\\"}]}This result includes the \\\"allUsers\\\" or IAM role added as members, causing this policy configuration to allow public access to cloud storage resources. There would be a similar concern if \\\"allAuthenticatedUsers\\\" was present.The command could be modified to remove \\\"allUsers\\\" and/or \\\"allAuthenticatedUsers\\\" as follows:(good code)Example Language:Shellgsutil iam ch -d allUsers gs://BUCKET_NAMEgsutil iam ch -d allAuthenticatedUsers gs://BUCKET_NAME\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2022-29527Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.CVE-2009-3482Anti-virus product sets insecure \\\"Everyone: Full Control\\\" permissions for files under the \\\"Program Files\\\" folder, allowing attackers to replace executables with Trojan horses.CVE-2009-3897Product creates directories with 0777 permissions at installation, allowing users to gain privileges and access a socket used for authentication.CVE-2009-3489Photo editor installs a service with an insecure security descriptor, allowing users to stop or start the service, or execute commands as SYSTEM.CVE-2020-15708socket created with insecure permissionsCVE-2009-3289Library function copies a file to a new target and uses the source file's permissions for the target, which is incorrect when the source file is a symbolic link, which typically has 0777 permissions.CVE-2009-0115Device driver uses world-writable permissions for a socket file, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary commands.CVE-2009-1073LDAP server stores a cleartext password in a world-readable file.CVE-2009-0141Terminal emulator creates TTY devices with world-writable permissions, allowing an attacker to write to the terminals of other users.CVE-2008-0662VPN product stores user credentials in a registry key with \\\"Everyone: Full Control\\\" permissions, allowing attackers to steal the credentials.CVE-2008-0322Driver installs its device interface with \\\"Everyone: Write\\\" permissions.CVE-2009-3939Driver installs a file with world-writable permissions.CVE-2009-3611Product changes permissions to 0777 before deleting a backup; the permissions stay insecure for subsequent backups.CVE-2007-6033Product creates a share with \\\"Everyone: Full Control\\\" permissions, allowing arbitrary program execution.CVE-2007-5544Product uses \\\"Everyone: Full Control\\\" permissions for memory-mapped files (shared memory) in inter-process communication, allowing attackers to tamper with a session.CVE-2005-4868Database product uses read/write permissions for everyone for its shared memory, allowing theft of credentials.CVE-2004-1714Security product uses \\\"Everyone: Full Control\\\" permissions for its configuration files.CVE-2001-0006\\\"Everyone: Full Control\\\" permissions assigned to a mutex allows users to disable network connectivity.CVE-2002-0969Chain: database product contains buffer overflow that is only reachable through a .ini configuration file - which has \\\"Everyone: Full Control\\\" permissions.\",\n    \"References\": \"[REF-62] Mark Dowd, John McDonald\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand Justin Schuh. \\\"The Art of Software Security Assessment\\\".

For example, java.io.FilePermission in the Java SecurityManager allows the software to specify restrictions on file operations.This may not be a feasible solution, and it only limits the impact to the operating system; the rest of the application may still be subject to compromise.Be careful to avoidCWE-243and other weaknesses related to jails.Effectiveness: LimitedNote:The effectiveness of this mitigation depends on the prevention capabilities of the specific sandbox or jail being used and might only help to reduce the scope of an attack, such as restricting the attacker to certain system calls or limiting the portion of the file system that can be accessed.\\n\\nPhases:  Implementation; InstallationDuring program startup, explicitly set the default permissions or umask to the most restrictive setting possible. Also set the appropriate permissions during program installation.

It may be possible to define custom signatures that identify any custom functions that implement the permission checks and assignments.Automated Dynamic AnalysisAutomated dynamic analysis may be effective in detecting permission problems for system resources such as files, directories, shared memory, device interfaces, etc.However, since the software's intended security policy might allow loose permissions for certain operations (such as publishing a file on a web server), automated dynamic analysis may produce some false positives - i.e., warnings that do not have any security consequences or require any code changes.When custom permissions models are used - such as defining who can read messages in a particular forum in a bulletin board system - these can be difficult to detect using automated dynamic analysis. It may be possible to define custom signatures that identify any custom functions that implement the permission checks and assignments.Manual AnalysisThis weakness can be detected using tools and techniques that require manual (human) analysis, such as penetration testing, threat modeling, and interactive tools that allow the tester to record and modify an active session.Note:These may be more effective than strictly automated techniques. This is especially the case with weaknesses that are related to design and business rules.Manual Static AnalysisManual static analysis may be effective in detecting the use of custom permissions models and functions. The code could then be examined to identifying usage of the related functions. Then the human analyst could evaluate permission assignments in the context of the intended security model of the software.Manual Dynamic AnalysisManual dynamic analysis may be effective in detecting the use of custom permissions models and functions. The program could then be executed with a focus on exercising code paths that are related to the custom permissions. Then the human analyst could evaluate permission assignments in the context of the intended security model of the software.FuzzingFuzzing is not effective in detecting this weakness.Black BoxUse monitoring tools that examine the software's process as it interacts with the operating system and the network. This technique is useful in cases when source code is unavailable, if the software was not developed by you, or if you want to verify that the build phase did not introduce any new weaknesses. Examples include debuggers that directly attach to the running process; system-call tracing utilities such as truss (Solaris) and strace (Linux); system activity monitors such as FileMon, RegMon, Process Monitor, and other Sysinternals utilities (Windows); and sniffers and protocol analyzers that monitor network traffic.Attach the monitor to the process and watch for library functions or system calls on OS resources such as files, directories, and shared memory. Examine the arguments to these calls to infer which permissions are being used.Note:Note that this technique is only useful for permissions issues related to system resources. It is not likely to detect application-level business rules that are related to permissions, such as if a user of a blog system marks a post as \\\"private,\\\" but the blog system inadvertently marks it as \\\"public.\\\"Automated Static Analysis - Binary or BytecodeAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Cost effective for partial coverage:Inter-application Flow AnalysisEffectiveness: SOAR PartialManual Static Analysis - Binary or BytecodeAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Cost effective for partial coverage:Binary / Bytecode disassembler - then use manual analysis for vulnerabilities & anomaliesEffectiveness: SOAR PartialDynamic Analysis with Automated Results InterpretationAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Cost effective for partial coverage:Host-based Vulnerability Scanners - Examine configuration for flaws, verifying that audit mechanisms work, ensure host configuration meets certain predefined criteriaWeb Application ScannerWeb Services ScannerDatabase ScannersEffectiveness: SOAR PartialDynamic Analysis with Manual Results InterpretationAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Highly cost effective:Host Application Interface ScannerCost effective for partial coverage:Fuzz TesterFramework-based FuzzerAutomated Monitored ExecutionForced Path ExecutionEffectiveness: HighManual Static Analysis - Source CodeAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Highly cost effective:Manual Source Code Review (not inspections)Cost effective for partial coverage:Focused Manual Spotcheck - Focused manual analysis of sourceEffectiveness: HighAutomated Static Analysis - Source CodeAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Cost effective for partial coverage:Context-configured Source Code Weakness AnalyzerEffectiveness: SOAR PartialAutomated Static AnalysisAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Cost effective for partial coverage:Configuration CheckerEffectiveness: SOAR PartialArchitecture or Design ReviewAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Highly cost effective:Formal Methods / Correct-By-ConstructionCost effective for partial coverage:Inspection (IEEE 1028 standard) (can apply to requirements, design, source code, etc.)Effectiveness: High\",\n    \"Functional Areas\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Affected Resources\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Memberships\": \"NatureTypeIDNameMemberOf743CERT C Secure Coding Standard (2008) Chapter 10 - Input Output (FIO)MemberOf7532009 Top 25 - Porous DefensesMemberOf8032010 Top 25 - Porous DefensesMemberOf815OWASP Top Ten 2010 Category A6 - Security MisconfigurationMemberOf857The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011) Chapter 14 - Input Output (FIO)MemberOf859The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011) Chapter 16 - Platform Security (SEC)MemberOf860The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011) Chapter 17 - Runtime Environment (ENV)MemberOf8662011 Top 25 - Porous DefensesMemberOf877CERT C++ Secure Coding Section 09 - Input Output (FIO)MemberOf884CWE Cross-sectionMemberOf946SFP Secondary Cluster: Insecure Resource PermissionsMemberOf1003Weaknesses for Simplified Mapping of Published VulnerabilitiesMemberOf1147SEI CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java - Guidelines 13.

It intends to perform an \\\"ls -l\\\" on an input filename. The validate_name() subroutine performs validation on the input to make sure that only alphanumeric and \\\"-\\\" characters are allowed, which avoids path traversal (CWE-22) and OS command injection (CWE-78) weaknesses. Only filenames like \\\"abc\\\" or \\\"d-e-f\\\" are intended to be allowed.(bad code)Example Language:Perlmy $arg = GetArgument(\\\"filename\\\");do_listing($arg);sub do_listing {my($fname) = @_;if (! validate_name($fname)) {print \\\"Error: name is not well-formed!\\\\n\\\";return;}# build commandmy $cmd = \\\"/bin/ls -l $fname\\\";system($cmd);}sub validate_name {my($name) = @_;if ($name =~ /^[\\\\w\\\\-]+$/) {return(1);}else {return(0);}}However, validate_name() allows filenames that begin with a \\\"-\\\". An adversary could supply a filename like \\\"-aR\\\", producing the \\\"ls -l -aR\\\" command (CWE-88), thereby getting a full recursive listing of the entire directory and all of its sub-directories.There are a couple possible mitigations for this\\n\\t       weakness. One would be to refactor the code to avoid\\n\\t       using system() altogether, instead relying on internal\\n\\t       functions.Another option could be to add a \\\"--\\\" argument\\n\\t       to the ls command, such as \\\"ls -l --\\\", so that any\\n\\t       remaining arguments are treated as filenames, causing\\n\\t       any leading \\\"-\\\" to be treated as part of a filename\\n\\t       instead of another option.Another fix might be to change the regular expression used in validate_name to force the first character of the filename to be a letter or number, such as:(good code)Example Language:Perlif ($name =~ /^\\\\w[\\\\w\\\\-]+$/) ...Example 2CVE-2016-10033 / [REF-1249] provides a useful real-world example of this weakness within PHPMailer.The program calls PHP's mail() function to compose and send mail. The fifth argument to mail() is a set of parameters. The program intends to provide a \\\"-fSENDER\\\" parameter, where SENDER is expected to be a well-formed email address. The program has already validated the e-mail address before invoking mail(), but there is a lot of flexibility in what constitutes a well-formed email address, including whitespace. With some additional allowed characters to perform some escaping, the adversary can specify an additional \\\"-o\\\" argument (listing an output file) and a \\\"-X\\\" argument (giving a program to execute).

Some languages or frameworks have functions that support specifying independent arguments, e.g. as an array, which is used to automatically perform the appropriate quoting or escaping while building the command. For example, in PHP, escapeshellarg() can be used to escape a single argument to system(), or exec() can be called with an array of arguments. In C, code can often be refactored from using system() - which accepts a single string - to using exec(), which requires separate function arguments for each parameter.Effectiveness: High\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignStrategy:  Input ValidationUnderstand all the potential areas where untrusted inputs can enter your product: parameters or arguments, cookies, anything read from the network, environment variables, request headers as well as content, URL components, e-mail, files, databases, and any external systems that provide data to the application. Perform input validation at well-defined interfaces.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Input ValidationAssume all input is malicious. Use an \\\"accept known good\\\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \\\"boat\\\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \\\"red\\\" or \\\"blue.\\\"Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationDirectly convert your input type into the expected data type, such as using a conversion function that translates a string into a number. After converting to the expected data type, ensure that the input's values fall within the expected range of allowable values and that multi-field consistencies are maintained.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationInputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180,CWE-181). Make sure that your application does not inadvertently decode the same input twice (CWE-174). Such errors could be used to bypass allowlist schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked. Use libraries such as the OWASP ESAPI Canonicalization control.Consider performing repeated canonicalization until your input does not change any more. This will avoid double-decoding and similar scenarios, but it might inadvertently modify inputs that are allowed to contain properly-encoded dangerous content.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationWhen exchanging data between components, ensure that both components are using the same character encoding. Ensure that the proper encoding is applied at each interface. Explicitly set the encoding you are using whenever the protocol allows you to do so.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationWhen your application combines data from multiple sources, perform the validation after the sources have been combined. The individual data elements may pass the validation step but violate the intended restrictions after they have been combined.\\n\\nPhase:  TestingUse automated static analysis tools that target this type of weakness. Many modern techniques use data flow analysis to minimize the number of false positives. This is not a perfect solution, since 100% accuracy and coverage are not feasible.\\n\\nPhase:  TestingUse dynamic tools and techniques that interact with the product using large test suites with many diverse inputs, such as fuzz testing (fuzzing), robustness testing, and fault injection.

Use an appropriate combination of denylists and allowlists to ensure only valid, expected and appropriate input is processed by the system.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Input ValidationAssume all input is malicious. Use an \\\"accept known good\\\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \\\"boat\\\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \\\"red\\\" or \\\"blue.\\\"Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Output EncodingWhile it is risky to use dynamically-generated query strings, code, or commands that mix control and data together, sometimes it may be unavoidable. Properly quote arguments and escape any special characters within those arguments. The most conservative approach is to escape or filter all characters that do not pass an extremely strict allowlist (such as everything that is not alphanumeric or white space). If some special characters are still needed, such as white space, wrap each argument in quotes after the escaping/filtering step. Be careful of argument injection (CWE-88).\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Input ValidationInputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180). Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice (CWE-174).

This program intends to authenticate the user before deciding whether a private message should be displayed. Assume that LookupMessageObject() ensures that the $id argument is numeric, constructs a filename based on that id, and reads the message details from that file. Also assume that the program stores all private messages for all users in the same directory.(bad code)Example Language:Perlsub DisplayPrivateMessage {my($id) = @_;my $Message = LookupMessageObject($id);print \\\"From: \\\" . encodeHTML($Message->{from}) . \\\"<br>\\\\n\\\";print \\\"Subject: \\\" . encodeHTML($Message->{subject}) . \\\"\\\\n\\\";print \\\"<hr>\\\\n\\\";print \\\"Body: \\\" . encodeHTML($Message->{body}) . \\\"\\\\n\\\";}my $q = new CGI;# For purposes of this example, assume thatCWE-309and#CWE-523do not apply.if (!

These checks may be different than the access control checks that are applied to more generic resources such as files, connections, processes, memory, and database records. For example, a database may restrict access for medical records to a specific database user, but each record might only be intended to be accessible to the patient and the patient's doctor [REF-7].\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignStrategy:  Libraries or FrameworksUse a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.For example, consider using authorization frameworks such as the JAAS Authorization Framework [REF-233] and the OWASP ESAPI Access Control feature [REF-45].\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignFor web applications, make sure that the access control mechanism is enforced correctly at the server side on every page. Users should not be able to access any unauthorized functionality or information by simply requesting direct access to that page.One way to do this is to ensure that all pages containing sensitive information are not cached, and that all such pages restrict access to requests that are accompanied by an active and authenticated session token associated with a user who has the required permissions to access that page.\\n\\nPhases:  System Configuration; InstallationUse the access control capabilities of your operating system and server environment and define your access control lists accordingly.

A tool may be able to analyze related configuration files, such as .htaccess in Apache web servers, or detect the usage of commonly-used authorization libraries.Generally, automated static analysis tools have difficulty detecting custom authorization schemes. In addition, the software's design may include some functionality that is accessible to any user and does not require an authorization check; an automated technique that detects the absence of authorization may report false positives.Effectiveness: LimitedAutomated Dynamic AnalysisAutomated dynamic analysis may find many or all possible interfaces that do not require authorization, but manual analysis is required to determine if the lack of authorization violates business logic.Manual AnalysisThis weakness can be detected using tools and techniques that require manual (human) analysis, such as penetration testing, threat modeling, and interactive tools that allow the tester to record and modify an active session.Specifically, manual static analysis is useful for evaluating the correctness of custom authorization mechanisms.Effectiveness: ModerateNote:These may be more effective than strictly automated techniques. This is especially the case with weaknesses that are related to design and business rules. However, manual efforts might not achieve desired code coverage within limited time constraints.Manual Static Analysis - Binary or BytecodeAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Cost effective for partial coverage:Binary / Bytecode disassembler - then use manual analysis for vulnerabilities & anomaliesEffectiveness: SOAR PartialDynamic Analysis with Automated Results InterpretationAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Cost effective for partial coverage:Web Application ScannerWeb Services ScannerDatabase ScannersEffectiveness: SOAR PartialDynamic Analysis with Manual Results InterpretationAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Cost effective for partial coverage:Host Application Interface ScannerFuzz TesterFramework-based FuzzerEffectiveness: SOAR PartialManual Static Analysis - Source CodeAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Cost effective for partial coverage:Focused Manual Spotcheck - Focused manual analysis of sourceManual Source Code Review (not inspections)Effectiveness: SOAR PartialAutomated Static Analysis - Source CodeAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Cost effective for partial coverage:Source code Weakness AnalyzerContext-configured Source Code Weakness AnalyzerEffectiveness: SOAR PartialArchitecture or Design ReviewAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Highly cost effective:Inspection (IEEE 1028 standard) (can apply to requirements, design, source code, etc.)Formal Methods / Correct-By-ConstructionEffectiveness: High\",\n    \"Functional Areas\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Affected Resources\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Memberships\": \"NatureTypeIDNameMemberOf813OWASP Top Ten 2010 Category A4 - Insecure Direct Object ReferencesMemberOf817OWASP Top Ten 2010 Category A8 - Failure to Restrict URL AccessMemberOf8662011 Top 25 - Porous DefensesMemberOf884CWE Cross-sectionMemberOf1003Weaknesses for Simplified Mapping of Published VulnerabilitiesMemberOf1337Weaknesses in the 2021 CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software WeaknessesMemberOf1345OWASP Top Ten 2021 Category A01:2021 - Broken Access ControlMemberOf1350Weaknesses in the 2020 CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software WeaknessesMemberOf1387Weaknesses in the 2022 CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software WeaknessesMemberOf1396Comprehensive Categorization: Access ControlMemberOf1425Weaknesses in the 2023 CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses\",\n    \"Vulnerability Mapping Notes\": \"Usage:ALLOWED-WITH-REVIEW(this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities in limited situations requiring careful review)Reason:AbstractionRationale:This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriateComments:Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\",\n    \"Notes\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Taxonomy Mappings\": \"Mapped Taxonomy NameNode IDFitMapped Node NameISA/IEC 62443Part 2-1Req 4.3.3.7ISA/IEC 62443Part 3-3Req SR 2.1ISA/IEC 62443Part 4-2Req CR 2.1\",\n    \"Related Attack Patterns\": \"CAPEC-IDAttack Pattern NameCAPEC-665Exploitation of Thunderbolt Protection Flaws\"\n}"}]}

The program is installed setuid root because it is intended for use as a learning tool to allow system administrators in-training to inspect privileged system files without giving them the ability to modify them or damage the system.(bad code)Example Language:Cint main(int argc, char** argv) {char cmd[CMD_MAX] = \\\"/usr/bin/cat \\\";strcat(cmd, argv[1]);system(cmd);}Because the program runs with root privileges, the call to system() also executes with root privileges. If a user specifies a standard filename, the call works as expected. However, if an attacker passes a string of the form \\\";rm -rf /\\\", then the call to system() fails to execute cat due to a lack of arguments and then plows on to recursively delete the contents of the root partition.Note that if argv[1] is a very long argument, then this issue might also be subject to a buffer overflow (CWE-120).Example 2The following code is from an administrative web application designed to allow users to kick off a backup of an Oracle database using a batch-file wrapper around the rman utility and then run a cleanup.bat script to delete some temporary files. The script rmanDB.bat accepts a single command line parameter, which specifies what type of backup to perform. Because access to the database is restricted, the application runs the backup as a privileged user.(bad code)Example Language:Java...String btype = request.getParameter(\\\"backuptype\\\");String cmd = new String(\\\"cmd.exe /K \\\\\\\"c:\\\\\\\\util\\\\\\\\rmanDB.bat \\\"+btype+\\\"&&c:\\\\\\\\utl\\\\\\\\cleanup.bat\\\\\\\"\\\")System.Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd);...The problem here is that the program does not do any validation on the backuptype parameter read from the user. Typically the Runtime.exec() function will not execute multiple commands, but in this case the program first runs the cmd.exe shell in order to run multiple commands with a single call to Runtime.exec(). Once the shell is invoked, it will happily execute multiple commands separated by two ampersands. If an attacker passes a string of the form \\\"& del c:\\\\\\\\dbms\\\\\\\\*.*\\\", then the application will execute this command along with the others specified by the program. Because of the nature of the application, it runs with the privileges necessary to interact with the database, which means whatever command the attacker injects will run with those privileges as well.Example 3The following code from a system utility uses the system property APPHOME to determine the directory in which it is installed and then executes an initialization script based on a relative path from the specified directory.(bad code)Example Language:Java...String home = System.getProperty(\\\"APPHOME\\\");String cmd = home + INITCMD;java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd);...The code above allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the elevated privilege of the application by modifying the system property APPHOME to point to a different path containing a malicious version of INITCMD. Because the program does not validate the value read from the environment, if an attacker can control the value of the system property APPHOME, then they can fool the application into running malicious code and take control of the system.Example 4The following code is a wrapper around the UNIX command cat which prints the contents of a file to standard out. It is also injectable:(bad code)Example Language:C#include <stdio.h>#include <unistd.h>int main(int argc, char **argv) {char cat[] = \\\"cat \\\";char *command;size_t commandLength;commandLength = strlen(cat) + strlen(argv[1]) + 1;command = (char *) malloc(commandLength);strncpy(command, cat, commandLength);strncat(command, argv[1], (commandLength - strlen(cat)) );system(command);return (0);}Used normally, the output is simply the contents of the file requested:(informative)$ ./catWrapper Story.txtWhen last we left our heroes...However, if we add a semicolon and another command to the end of this line, the command is executed by catWrapper with no complaint:(attack code)$ ./catWrapper Story.txt; lsWhen last we left our heroes...Story.txtSensitiveFile.txtPrivateData.dba.out*If catWrapper had been set to have a higher privilege level than the standard user, arbitrary commands could be executed with that higher privilege.\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2022-36069Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash, potentially allowing for code execution.CVE-1999-0067Canonical example of OS command injection.

This will cause $uid to be regarded as equivalent to \\\"0\\\" in the conditional, allowing the original user to perform administrator actions. Even if the attacker cannot directly influence the state data, unexpected errors could cause incorrect privileges to be assigned to a user just by accident.Example 3The following code intends to concatenate a string to a variable and print the string.(bad code)Example Language:Cchar str[20];strcat(str, \\\"hello world\\\");printf(\\\"%s\\\", str);This might seem innocent enough, but str was not initialized, so it contains random memory. As a result, str[0] might not contain the null terminator, so the copy might start at an offset other than 0. The consequences can vary, depending on the underlying memory.If a null terminator is found before str[8], then some bytes of random garbage will be printed before the \\\"hello world\\\" string. The memory might contain sensitive information from previous uses, such as a password (which might occur as a result ofCWE-14orCWE-244). In this example, it might not be a big deal, but consider what could happen if large amounts of memory are printed out before the null terminator is found.If a null terminator isn't found before str[8], then a buffer overflow could occur, since strcat will first look for the null terminator, then copy 12 bytes starting with that location. Alternately, a buffer over-read might occur (CWE-126) if a null terminator isn't found before the end of the memory segment is reached, leading to a segmentation fault and crash.Example 4This example will leave test_string in an unknown condition when i is the same value as err_val, because test_string is not initialized (CWE-456).

Because the buffer pwd contains a sensitive value, the application may be vulnerable to attack if the data are left memory resident. If attackers are able to access the correct region of memory, they may use the recovered password to gain control of the system.It is common practice to overwrite sensitive data manipulated in memory, such as passwords or cryptographic keys, in order to prevent attackers from learning system secrets. However, with the advent of optimizing compilers, programs do not always behave as their source code alone would suggest. In the example, the compiler interprets the call to memset() as dead code because the memory being written to is not subsequently used, despite the fact that there is clearly a security motivation for the operation to occur. The problem here is that many compilers, and in fact many programming languages, do not take this and other security concerns into consideration in their efforts to improve efficiency.Attackers typically exploit this type of vulnerability by using a core dump or runtime mechanism to access the memory used by a particular application and recover the secret information.

For example, using a hash function without a salt for storing passwords (that are sufficiently short) could enable an adversary to create a \\\"rainbow table\\\" [REF-637] to recover the password under certain conditions; this attack works against such hash functions as MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-2.\",\n    \"Alternate Terms\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Relationships\": \"Relevant to the view \\\"Research Concepts\\\" (CWE-1000)NatureTypeIDNameChildOf326Inadequate Encryption StrengthChildOf327Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic AlgorithmParentOf916Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational EffortRelevant to the view \\\"Software Development\\\" (CWE-699)NatureTypeIDNameMemberOf310Cryptographic IssuesRelevant to the view \\\"Architectural Concepts\\\" (CWE-1008)NatureTypeIDNameMemberOf1013Encrypt Data\",\n    \"Modes of Introduction\": \"PhaseNote\\n\\nArchitecture and DesignCOMMISSION: This weakness refers to an incorrect design related to an architectural security tactic.\",\n    \"Applicable Platforms\": \"Languages\\n\\nClass: Not Language-Specific(Undetermined Prevalence)\\n\\nTechnologies\\n\\nClass: ICS/OT(Undetermined Prevalence)\",\n    \"Common Consequences\": \"ScopeImpactLikelihood\\n\\nAccess ControlTechnical Impact:Bypass Protection Mechanism\",\n    \"Likelihood of Exploit\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Demonstrative Examples\": \"Example 1In both of these examples, a user is logged in if their given password matches a stored password:(bad code)Example Language:Cunsigned char *check_passwd(char *plaintext) {ctext = simple_digest(\\\"sha1\\\",plaintext,strlen(plaintext), ... );//Login if hash matches stored hashif (equal(ctext, secret_password())) {login_user();}}(bad code)Example Language:JavaString plainText = new String(plainTextIn);MessageDigest encer = MessageDigest.getInstance(\\\"SHA\\\");encer.update(plainTextIn);byte[] digest = password.digest();//Login if hash matches stored hashif (equal(digest,secret_password())) {login_user();}This code relies exclusively on a password mechanism (CWE-309) using only one factor of authentication (CWE-308). If an attacker can steal or guess a user's password, they are given full access to their account. Note this code also uses SHA-1, which is a weak hash (CWE-328). It also does not use a salt (CWE-759).Example 2In 2022, the OT:ICEFALL study examined products by 10 different Operational Technology (OT) vendors. The researchers reported 56 vulnerabilities and said that the products were \\\"insecure by design\\\" [REF-1283]. If exploited, these vulnerabilities often allowed adversaries to change how the products operated, ranging from denial of service to changing the code that the products executed. Since these products were often used in industries such as power, electrical, water, and others, there could even be safety implications.At least one OT product used weak hashes.Example 3The example code below is taken from the JTAG access control mechanism of the Hack@DAC'21 buggy OpenPiton SoC [REF-1360]. Access to JTAG allows users to access sensitive information in the system. Hence, access to JTAG is controlled using cryptographic authentication of the users. In this example (see the vulnerable code source), the password checker uses HMAC-SHA256 for authentication. It takes a 512-bit secret message from the user, hashes it using HMAC, and compares its output with the expected output to determine the authenticity of the user.(bad code)Example Language:Verilog...logic [31:0] data_d,data_qlogic [512-1:0] pass_data;...Write: begin...if (pass_mode) beginpass_data = { {60{8'h00}}, data_d};state_d = PassChk;pass_mode = 1'b0;...end...The vulnerable code shows an incorrect implementation of the HMAC authentication where it only uses the least significant 32 bits of the secret message for the authentication (the remaining 480 bits are hard coded as zeros). As a result, the system is susceptible to brute-force attacks where the attacker only needs to determine 32 bits of the secret message instead of 512 bits, weakening the cryptographic protocol.To mitigate, remove the zero padding and use all 512 bits of the secret message for HMAC authentication [REF-1361].(good code)Example Language:Verilog...logic [512-1:0] data_d,data_qlogic [512-1:0] pass_data;...Write: begin...if (pass_mode) beginpass_data = data_d;state_d = PassChk;pass_mode = 1'b0;...end...\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2022-30320Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) uses a protocol with a cryptographically insecure hashing algorithm for passwords.CVE-2005-4900SHA-1 algorithm is not collision-resistant.CVE-2020-25685DNS product uses a weak hash (CRC32 or SHA-1) of the query name, allowing attacker to forge responses by computing domain names with the same hash.CVE-2012-6707blogging product uses MD5-based algorithm for passwords.CVE-2019-14855forging of certificate signatures using SHA-1 collisions.CVE-2017-15999mobile app for backup sends SHA-1 hash of password in cleartext.CVE-2006-4068Hard-coded hashed values for username and password contained in client-side script, allowing brute-force offline attacks.\",\n    \"References\": \"[REF-289] Alexander Sotirov et al.. \\\"MD5 considered harmful today\\\". <http://www.phreedom.org/research/rogue-ca/>.URL validated: 2023-04-07.[REF-62] Mark Dowd, John McDonald\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand Justin Schuh. \\\"The Art of Software Security Assessment\\\".

For example, rainbow table attacks can become infeasible due to the high computing overhead. Finally, since computing power gets faster and cheaper over time, the technique can be reconfigured to increase the workload without forcing an entire replacement of the algorithm in use.Some hash functions that have one or more of these desired properties include bcrypt [REF-291], scrypt [REF-292], and PBKDF2 [REF-293]. While there is active debate about which of these is the most effective, they are all stronger than using salts with hash functions with very little computing overhead.Note that using these functions can have an impact on performance, so they require special consideration to avoid denial-of-service attacks.

If this output is redirected to a web user, this may represent a security problem.Example 2This code tries to open a database connection, and prints any exceptions that occur.(bad code)Example Language:PHPtry {openDbConnection();}//print exception message that includes exception message and configuration file locationcatch (Exception $e) {echo 'Caught exception: ', $e->getMessage(), '\\\\n';echo 'Check credentials in config file at: ', $Mysql_config_location, '\\\\n';}If an exception occurs, the printed message exposes the location of the configuration file the script is using. An attacker can use this information to target the configuration file (perhaps exploiting a Path Traversal weakness). If the file can be read, the attacker could gain credentials for accessing the database. The attacker may also be able to replace the file with a malicious one, causing the application to use an arbitrary database.Example 3The following code generates an error message that leaks the full pathname of the configuration file.(bad code)Example Language:Perl$ConfigDir = \\\"/home/myprog/config\\\";$uname = GetUserInput(\\\"username\\\");# avoidCWE-22,CWE-78, others.ExitError(\\\"Bad hacker!\\\") if ($uname !~ /^\\\\w+$/);$file = \\\"$ConfigDir/$uname.txt\\\";if (! (-e $file)) {ExitError(\\\"Error: $file does not exist\\\");}...If this code is running on a server, such as a web application, then the person making the request should not know what the full pathname of the configuration directory is. By submitting a username that does not produce a $file that exists, an attacker could get this pathname. It could then be used to exploit path traversal or symbolic link following problems that may exist elsewhere in the application.Example 4In the example below, the method getUserBankAccount retrieves a bank account object from a database using the supplied username and account number to query the database. If an SQLException is raised when querying the database, an error message is created and output to a log file.(bad code)Example Language:Javapublic BankAccount getUserBankAccount(String username, String accountNumber) {BankAccount userAccount = null;String query = null;try {if (isAuthorizedUser(username)) {query = \\\"SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE owner = \\\"+ username + \\\" AND accountID = \\\" + accountNumber;DatabaseManager dbManager = new DatabaseManager();Connection conn = dbManager.getConnection();Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();ResultSet queryResult = stmt.executeQuery(query);userAccount = (BankAccount)queryResult.getObject(accountNumber);}} catch (SQLException ex) {String logMessage = \\\"Unable to retrieve account information from database,\\\\nquery: \\\" + query;Logger.getLogger(BankManager.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, logMessage, ex);}return userAccount;}The error message that is created includes information about the database query that may contain sensitive information about the database or query logic. In this case, the error message will expose the table name and column names used in the database.

The messages need to strike the balance between being too cryptic (which can confuse users) or being too detailed (which may reveal more than intended).

Attackers can use detailed information to refine or optimize their original attack, thereby increasing their chances of success.If errors must be captured in some detail, record them in log messages, but consider what could occur if the log messages can be viewed by attackers.

The software's operation may slow down, but it should not become unstable, crash, or generate incorrect results.Error conditions may be triggered with a stress-test by calling the software simultaneously from a large number of threads or processes, and look for evidence of any unexpected behavior.Effectiveness: ModerateManual Dynamic AnalysisIdentify error conditions that are not likely to occur during normal usage and trigger them. For example, run the program under low memory conditions, run with insufficient privileges or permissions, interrupt a transaction before it is completed, or disable connectivity to basic network services such as DNS.

If you trigger an unhandled exception or similar error that was discovered and handled by the application's environment, it may still indicate unexpected conditions that were not handled by the application itself.Automated Static AnalysisAutomated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.

After finishing the loop, each string in the AP array points to a location within the input string.(bad code)Example Language:Cchar **ap, *argv[10], *inputstring;for (ap = argv; (*ap = strsep(&inputstring, \\\" \\\\t\\\")) != NULL;)if (**ap != '\\\\0')if (++ap >= &argv[10])break;/.../free(ap[4]);Since strsep is not allocating any new memory, freeing an element in the middle of the array is equivalent to free a pointer in the middle of inputstring.Example 2This example allocates a BarObj object using the new operator in C++, however, the programmer then deallocates the object using free(), which may lead to unexpected behavior.(bad code)Example Language:C++void foo(){BarObj *ptr = new BarObj()/* do some work with ptr here */...free(ptr);}Instead, the programmer should have either created the object with one of the malloc family functions, or else deleted the object with the delete operator.(good code)Example Language:C++void foo(){BarObj *ptr = new BarObj()/* do some work with ptr here */...delete ptr;}Example 3In this example, the programmer dynamically allocates a buffer to hold a string and then searches for a specific character. After completing the search, the programmer attempts to release the allocated memory and return SUCCESS or FAILURE to the caller. Note: for simplification, this example uses a hard-coded \\\"Search Me!\\\" string and a constant string length of 20.(bad code)Example Language:C#define SUCCESS (1)#define FAILURE (0)int contains_char(char c){char *str;str = (char*)malloc(20*sizeof(char));strcpy(str, \\\"Search Me!\\\");while( *str != NULL){if( *str == c ){/* matched char, free string and return success */free(str);return SUCCESS;}/* didn't match yet, increment pointer and try next char */str = str + 1;}/* we did not match the char in the string, free mem and return failure */free(str);return FAILURE;}However, if the character is not at the beginning of the string, or if it is not in the string at all, then the pointer will not be at the start of the buffer when the programmer frees it.Instead of freeing the pointer in the middle of the buffer, the programmer can use an indexing pointer to step through the memory or abstract the memory calculations by using array indexing.(good code)Example Language:C#define SUCCESS (1)#define FAILURE (0)int cointains_char(char c){char *str;int i = 0;str = (char*)malloc(20*sizeof(char));strcpy(str, \\\"Search Me!\\\");while( i < strlen(str) ){if( str[i] == c ){/* matched char, free string and return success */free(str);return SUCCESS;}/* didn't match yet, increment pointer and try next char */i = i + 1;}/* we did not match the char in the string, free mem and return failure */free(str);return FAILURE;}Example 4Consider the following code in the context of a parsing application to extract commands out of user data. The intent is to parse each command and add it to a queue of commands to be executed, discarding each malformed entry.(bad code)Example Language:C//hardcode input length for simplicitychar* input = (char*) malloc(40*sizeof(char));char *tok;char* sep = \\\" \\\\t\\\";get_user_input( input );/* The following loop will parse and process each token in the input string */tok = strtok( input, sep);while( NULL != tok ){if( isMalformed( tok ) ){/* ignore and discard bad data */free( tok );}else{add_to_command_queue( tok );}tok = strtok( NULL, sep));}While the above code attempts to free memory associated with bad commands, since the memory was all allocated in one chunk, it must all be freed together.One way to fix this problem would be to copy the commands into a new memory location before placing them in the queue. Then, after all commands have been processed, the memory can safely be freed.(good code)Example Language:C//hardcode input length for simplicitychar* input = (char*) malloc(40*sizeof(char));char *tok, *command;char* sep = \\\" \\\\t\\\";get_user_input( input );/* The following loop will parse and process each token in the input string */tok = strtok( input, sep);while( NULL != tok ){if( !isMalformed( command ) ){/* copy and enqueue good data */command = (char*) malloc( (strlen(tok) + 1) * sizeof(char) );strcpy( command, tok );add_to_command_queue( command );}tok = strtok( NULL, sep));}free( input )\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2019-11930function \\\"internally calls 'calloc' and returns a pointer at an index... inside the allocated buffer.

This often exists in Linux-based code assuming the controlled nature of the root directory (/) or its subdirectories (/etc, etc), or a code that recursively accesses the parent directory. In Windows, the drive root and some of its subdirectories have weak permissions by default, which makes them uncontrolled.\\n\\nIn some Unix-based systems, a PATH might be created that contains an empty element, e.g. by splicing an empty variable into the PATH. This empty element can be interpreted as equivalent to the current working directory, which might be an untrusted search element.\\n\\nIn software package management frameworks (e.g., npm, RubyGems, or PyPi), the framework may identify dependencies on third-party libraries or other packages, then consult a repository that contains the desired package. The framework may search a public repository before a private repository. This could be exploited by attackers by placing a malicious package in the public repository that has the same name as a package from the private repository. The search path might not be directly under control of the developer relying on the framework, but this search order effectively contains an untrusted element.\",\n    \"Alternate Terms\": \"DLL preloading:This term is one of several that are used to describe exploitation of untrusted search path elements in Windows systems, which received wide attention in August 2010.

In this environment, user passwords can be managed using the Network Information System (NIS), which is commonly used on UNIX systems. When performing NIS updates, part of the process for updating passwords is to run a make command in the /var/yp directory. Performing NIS updates requires extra privileges.(bad code)Example Language:Java...System.Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\\\"make\\\");...The problem here is that the program does not specify an absolute path for make and does not clean its environment prior to executing the call to Runtime.exec(). If an attacker can modify the $PATH variable to point to a malicious binary called make and cause the program to be executed in their environment, then the malicious binary will be loaded instead of the one intended. Because of the nature of the application, it runs with the privileges necessary to perform system operations, which means the attacker's make will now be run with these privileges, possibly giving the attacker complete control of the system.Example 2In versions of Go prior to v1.19, the LookPath function would follow the conventions of the runtime OS and look for a program in the directiories listed in the current path [REF-1325].Therefore, Go would prioritize searching the current directory when the provided command name does not contain a directory separator and continued to search for programs even when the specified program name is empty.Consider the following where an application executes a git command to run on the system.(bad code)Example Language:Gofunc ExecuteGitCommand(name string, arg []string) error {c := exec.Command(name, arg...)var err errorc.Path, err = exec.LookPath(name)if err != nil {return err}}An attacker could create a malicious repository with a file named ..exe and another file named git.exe. If git.exe is not found in the system PATH, then ..exe would execute [REF-1326].Example 3In February 2021 [REF-1169], a researcher was able to demonstrate the ability to breach major technology companies by using \\\"dependency confusion\\\" where the companies would download and execute untrusted packages.The researcher discovered the names of some internal, private packages by looking at dependency lists in public source code, such as package.json. The researcher then created new, untrusted packages with the same name as the internal packages, then uploaded them to package hosting services. These services included the npm registry for Node, PyPi for Python, and RubyGems. In affected companies, their dependency resolution would search the public hosting services first before consulting their internal service, causing the untrusted packages to be automatically downloaded and executed.\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2023-25815chain: a change in an underlying package causes the gettext function to use implicit initialization with a hard-coded path (CWE-1419) under the user-writable C:\\\\ drive, introducing an untrusted search path element (CWE-427) that enables spoofing of messages.CVE-2022-4826Go-based git extension on Windows can search for and execute a malicious \\\"..exe\\\" in a repository because Go searches the current working directory if git.exe is not found in the PATHCVE-2020-26284A Static Site Generator built in Go, when running on Windows, searches the current working directory for a command, possibly allowing code execution using a malicious .exe or .bat file with the name being searchedCVE-2022-24765Windows-based fork of git creates a \\\".git\\\" folder in the C: drive, allowing local attackers to create a .git folder with a malicious config fileCVE-2019-1552SSL package searches under \\\"C:/usr/local\\\" for configuration files and other critical data, but C:/usr/local might be world-writable.CVE-2010-3402\\\"DLL hijacking\\\" issue in document editor.CVE-2010-3397\\\"DLL hijacking\\\" issue in encryption software.CVE-2010-3138\\\"DLL hijacking\\\" issue in library used by multiple media players.CVE-2010-3152\\\"DLL hijacking\\\" issue in illustration program.CVE-2010-3147\\\"DLL hijacking\\\" issue in address book.CVE-2010-3135\\\"DLL hijacking\\\" issue in network monitoring software.CVE-2010-3131\\\"DLL hijacking\\\" issue in web browser.CVE-2010-1795\\\"DLL hijacking\\\" issue in music player/organizer.CVE-2002-1576Product uses the current working directory to find and execute a program, which allows local users to gain privileges by creating a symlink that points to a malicious version of the program.CVE-1999-1461Product trusts the PATH environmental variable to find and execute a program, which allows local users to obtain root access by modifying the PATH to point to a malicous version of that program.CVE-1999-1318Software uses a search path that includes the current working directory (.), which allows local users to gain privileges via malicious programs.CVE-2003-0579Admin software trusts the user-supplied -uv.install command line option to find and execute the uv.install program, which allows local users to gain privileges by providing a pathname that is under control of the user.CVE-2000-0854When a document is opened, the directory of that document is first used to locate DLLs , which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands by inserting malicious DLLs into the same directory as the document.CVE-2001-0943Database trusts the PATH environment variable to find and execute programs, which allows local users to modify the PATH to point to malicious programs.CVE-2001-0942Database uses an environment variable to find and execute a program, which allows local users to execute arbitrary programs by changing the environment variable.CVE-2001-0507Server uses relative paths to find system files that will run in-process, which allows local users to gain privileges via a malicious file.CVE-2002-2017Product allows local users to execute arbitrary code by setting an environment variable to reference a malicious program.CVE-1999-0690Product includes the current directory in root's PATH variable.CVE-2001-0912Error during packaging causes product to include a hard-coded, non-standard directory in search path.CVE-2001-0289Product searches current working directory for configuration file.CVE-2005-1705Product searches current working directory for configuration file.CVE-2005-1307Product executable other program from current working directory.CVE-2002-2040Untrusted path.CVE-2005-2072Modification of trusted environment variable leads to untrusted path vulnerability.CVE-2005-1632Product searches /tmp for modules before other paths.\",\n    \"References\": \"[REF-409] Georgi Guninski. \\\"Double clicking on MS Office documents from Windows Explorer may execute arbitrary programs in some cases\\\".

Use an \\\"accept known good\\\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \\\"boat\\\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \\\"red\\\" or \\\"blue.\\\"Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Output EncodingWhile it is risky to use dynamically-generated query strings, code, or commands that mix control and data together, sometimes it may be unavoidable. Properly quote arguments and escape any special characters within those arguments. The most conservative approach is to escape or filter all characters that do not pass an extremely strict allowlist (such as everything that is not alphanumeric or white space). If some special characters are still needed, such as white space, wrap each argument in quotes after the escaping/filtering step. Be careful of argument injection (CWE-88).\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Input ValidationInputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180).

The message sizes are retrieved from a socket that returns in a buffer the message number and the message size, the message number (num) and size (size) are extracted from the buffer and the message size is placed into an array using the message number for the array index.(bad code)Example Language:C/* capture the sizes of all messages */int getsizes(int sock, int count, int *sizes) {...char buf[BUFFER_SIZE];int ok;int num, size;// read values from socket and added to sizes arraywhile ((ok = gen_recv(sock, buf, sizeof(buf))) == 0){// continue read from socket until buf only contains '.'if (DOTLINE(buf))break;else if (sscanf(buf, \\\"%d %d\\\", &num, &size) == 2)sizes[num - 1] = size;}...}In this example the message number retrieved from the buffer could be a value that is outside the allowable range of indices for the array and could possibly be a negative number. Without proper validation of the value to be used for the array index an array overflow could occur and could potentially lead to unauthorized access to memory addresses and system crashes. The value of the array index should be validated to ensure that it is within the allowable range of indices for the array as in the following code.(good code)Example Language:C/* capture the sizes of all messages */int getsizes(int sock, int count, int *sizes) {...char buf[BUFFER_SIZE];int ok;int num, size;// read values from socket and added to sizes arraywhile ((ok = gen_recv(sock, buf, sizeof(buf))) == 0){// continue read from socket until buf only contains '.'if (DOTLINE(buf))break;else if (sscanf(buf, \\\"%d %d\\\", &num, &size) == 2) {if (num > 0 && num <= (unsigned)count)sizes[num - 1] = size;else/* warn about possible attempt to induce buffer overflow */report(stderr, \\\"Warning: ignoring bogus data for message sizes returned by server.\\\\n\\\");}}...}Example 5In the following example the method displayProductSummary is called from a Web service servlet to retrieve product summary information for display to the user. The servlet obtains the integer value of the product number from the user and passes it to the displayProductSummary method. The displayProductSummary method passes the integer value of the product number to the getProductSummary method which obtains the product summary from the array object containing the project summaries using the integer value of the product number as the array index.(bad code)Example Language:Java// Method called from servlet to obtain product informationpublic String displayProductSummary(int index) {String productSummary = new String(\\\"\\\");try {String productSummary = getProductSummary(index);} catch (Exception ex) {...}return productSummary;}public String getProductSummary(int index) {return products[index];}In this example the integer value used as the array index that is provided by the user may be outside the allowable range of indices for the array which may provide unexpected results or cause the application to fail. The integer value used for the array index should be validated to ensure that it is within the allowable range of indices for the array as in the following code.(good code)Example Language:Java// Method called from servlet to obtain product informationpublic String displayProductSummary(int index) {String productSummary = new String(\\\"\\\");try {String productSummary = getProductSummary(index);} catch (Exception ex) {...}return productSummary;}public String getProductSummary(int index) {String productSummary = \\\"\\\";if ((index >= 0) && (index < MAX_PRODUCTS)) {productSummary = products[index];}else {System.err.println(\\\"index is out of bounds\\\");throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException();}return productSummary;}An alternative in Java would be to use one of the collection objects such as ArrayList that will automatically generate an exception if an attempt is made to access an array index that is out of bounds.(good code)Example Language:JavaArrayList productArray = new ArrayList(MAX_PRODUCTS);...try {productSummary = (String) productArray.get(index);} catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException ex) {...}Example 6The following example asks a user for an offset into an array to select an item.(bad code)Example Language:Cint main (int argc, char **argv) {char *items[] = {\\\"boat\\\", \\\"car\\\", \\\"truck\\\", \\\"train\\\"};int index = GetUntrustedOffset();printf(\\\"You selected %s\\\\n\\\", items[index-1]);}The programmer allows the user to specify which element in the list to select, however an attacker can provide an out-of-bounds offset, resulting in a buffer over-read (CWE-126).\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2005-0369large ID in packet used as array indexCVE-2001-1009negative array index as argument to POP LIST commandCVE-2003-0721Integer signedness error leads to negative array indexCVE-2004-1189product does not properly track a count and a maximum number, which can lead to resultant array index overflow.CVE-2007-5756Chain: device driver for packet-capturing software allows access to an unintended IOCTL with resultant array index error.CVE-2005-2456Chain: array index error (CWE-129) leads to deadlock (CWE-833)\",\n    \"References\": \"[REF-7] Michael Howard and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDavid LeBlanc. \\\"Writing Secure Code\\\".

Note that using a framework does not automatically address all input validation problems; be mindful of weaknesses that could arise from misusing the framework itself (CWE-1173).\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignFor any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoidCWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.Even though client-side checks provide minimal benefits with respect to server-side security, they are still useful. First, they can support intrusion detection. If the server receives input that should have been rejected by the client, then it may be an indication of an attack. Second, client-side error-checking can provide helpful feedback to the user about the expectations for valid input. Third, there may be a reduction in server-side processing time for accidental input errors, although this is typically a small savings.\\n\\nPhase:  RequirementsStrategy:  Language SelectionUse a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.For example, Ada allows the programmer to constrain the values of a variable and languages such as Java and Ruby will allow the programmer to handle exceptions when an out-of-bounds index is accessed.\\n\\nPhases:  Operation; Build and CompilationStrategy:  Environment HardeningRun or compile the software using features or extensions that randomly arrange the positions of a program's executable and libraries in memory. Because this makes the addresses unpredictable, it can prevent an attacker from reliably jumping to exploitable code.Examples include Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) [REF-58] [REF-60] and Position-Independent Executables (PIE) [REF-64]. Imported modules may be similarly realigned if their default memory addresses conflict with other modules, in a process known as \\\"rebasing\\\" (for Windows) and \\\"prelinking\\\" (for Linux) [REF-1332] using randomly generated addresses. ASLR for libraries cannot be used in conjunction with prelink since it would require relocating the libraries at run-time, defeating the whole purpose of prelinking.For more information on these techniques see D3-SAOR (Segment Address Offset Randomization) from D3FEND [REF-1335].Effectiveness: Defense in DepthNote:These techniques do not provide a complete solution. For instance, exploits frequently use a bug that discloses memory addresses in order to maximize reliability of code execution [REF-1337]. It has also been shown that a side-channel attack can bypass ASLR [REF-1333]\\n\\nPhase:  OperationStrategy:  Environment HardeningUse a CPU and operating system that offers Data Execution Protection (using hardware NX or XD bits) or the equivalent techniques that simulate this feature in software, such as PaX [REF-60] [REF-61]. These techniques ensure that any instruction executed is exclusively at a memory address that is part of the code segment.For more information on these techniques see D3-PSEP (Process Segment Execution Prevention) from D3FEND [REF-1336].Effectiveness: Defense in DepthNote:This is not a complete solution, since buffer overflows could be used to overwrite nearby variables to modify the software's state in dangerous ways. In addition, it cannot be used in cases in which self-modifying code is required. Finally, an attack could still cause a denial of service, since the typical response is to exit the application.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Input ValidationAssume all input is malicious. Use an \\\"accept known good\\\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \\\"boat\\\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \\\"red\\\" or \\\"blue.\\\"Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.When accessing a user-controlled array index, use a stringent range of values that are within the target array. Make sure that you do not allow negative values to be used. That is, verify the minimum as well as the maximum of the range of acceptable values.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationBe especially careful to validate all input when invoking code that crosses language boundaries, such as from an interpreted language to native code. This could create an unexpected interaction between the language boundaries. Ensure that you are not violating any of the expectations of the language with which you are interfacing. For example, even though Java may not be susceptible to buffer overflows, providing a large argument in a call to native code might trigger an overflow.\\n\\nPhases:  Architecture and Design; OperationStrategy:  Environment HardeningRun your code using the lowest privileges that are required to accomplish the necessary tasks [REF-76]. If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a single task. That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.\\n\\nPhases:  Architecture and Design; OperationStrategy:  Sandbox or JailRun the code in a \\\"jail\\\" or similar sandbox environment that enforces strict boundaries between the process and the operating system. This may effectively restrict which files can be accessed in a particular directory or which commands can be executed by the software.OS-level examples include the Unix chroot jail, AppArmor, and SELinux. In general, managed code may provide some protection. For example, java.io.FilePermission in the Java SecurityManager allows the software to specify restrictions on file operations.This may not be a feasible solution, and it only limits the impact to the operating system; the rest of the application may still be subject to compromise.Be careful to avoidCWE-243and other weaknesses related to jails.Effectiveness: LimitedNote:The effectiveness of this mitigation depends on the prevention capabilities of the specific sandbox or jail being used and might only help to reduce the scope of an attack, such as restricting the attacker to certain system calls or limiting the portion of the file system that can be accessed.\",\n    \"Weakness Ordinalities\": \"OrdinalityDescriptionResultant(where the weakness is a quality issue that might indirectly make it easier to introduce security-relevant weaknesses or make them more difficult to detect)The most common condition situation leading to an out-of-bounds array index is the use of loop index variables as buffer indexes. If the end condition for the loop is subject to a flaw, the index can grow or shrink unbounded, therefore causing a buffer overflow or underflow. Another common situation leading to this condition is the use of a function's return value, or the resulting value of a calculation directly as an index in to a buffer.\",\n    \"Detection Methods\": \"Automated Static AnalysisThis weakness can often be detected using automated static analysis tools. Many modern tools use data flow analysis or constraint-based techniques to minimize the number of false positives.Automated static analysis generally does not account for environmental considerations when reporting out-of-bounds memory operations. This can make it difficult for users to determine which warnings should be investigated first. For example, an analysis tool might report array index errors that originate from command line arguments in a program that is not expected to run with setuid or other special privileges.Effectiveness: HighNote:This is not a perfect solution, since 100% accuracy and coverage are not feasible.Automated Dynamic AnalysisThis weakness can be detected using dynamic tools and techniques that interact with the software using large test suites with many diverse inputs, such as fuzz testing (fuzzing), robustness testing, and fault injection. The software's operation may slow down, but it should not become unstable, crash, or generate incorrect results.Black BoxBlack box methods might not get the needed code coverage within limited time constraints, and a dynamic test might not produce any noticeable side effects even if it is successful.\",\n    \"Functional Areas\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Affected Resources\": \"Memory\",\n    \"Memberships\": \"NatureTypeIDNameMemberOf738CERT C Secure Coding Standard (2008) Chapter 5 - Integers (INT)MemberOf740CERT C Secure Coding Standard (2008) Chapter 7 - Arrays (ARR)MemberOf8022010 Top 25 - Risky Resource ManagementMemberOf8672011 Top 25 - Weaknesses On the CuspMemberOf872CERT C++ Secure Coding Section 04 - Integers (INT)MemberOf874CERT C++ Secure Coding Section 06 - Arrays and the STL (ARR)MemberOf884CWE Cross-sectionMemberOf970SFP Secondary Cluster: Faulty Buffer AccessMemberOf1131CISQ Quality Measures (2016) - SecurityMemberOf1160SEI CERT C Coding Standard - Guidelines 06.

During state A, it can read certain private keys from the hidden fuses that are only accessible in state A but not in state B. The device reads the keys, performs operations using those keys, then transitions to state B, where those private keys should no longer be accessible.(bad code)During the transition from A to B, the device does not scrub the memory.After the transition to state B, even though the private keys are no longer accessible directly from the fuses in state B, they can be accessed indirectly by reading the memory that contains the private keys.(good code)For transition from state A to state B, remove information which should not be available once the transition is complete.Example 2The following code calls realloc() on a buffer containing sensitive data:(bad code)Example Language:Ccleartext_buffer = get_secret();...cleartext_buffer = realloc(cleartext_buffer, 1024);...scrub_memory(cleartext_buffer, 1024);There is an attempt to scrub the sensitive data from memory, but realloc() is used, so it could return a pointer to a different part of memory. The memory that was originally allocated for cleartext_buffer could still contain an uncleared copy of the data.Example 3The following example code is excerpted from the AES wrapper/interface, aes0_wrapper, module of \\n\\t\\t one of the AES engines (AES0) in the Hack@DAC'21 buggy OpenPiton System-on-Chip (SoC). Note that \\n\\t\\t this SoC contains three distinct AES engines. Within this wrapper module, four 32-bit registers are \\n\\t\\t utilized to store the message intended for encryption, referred to as p_c[i]. Using the AXI Lite \\n\\t\\t interface, these registers are filled with the 128-bit message to be encrypted.(bad code)Example Language:Verilogmodule aes0_wrapper #(...)(...);...always @(posedge clk_i)beginif(~(rst_ni && ~rst_1)) //clear p_c[i] at resetbeginstart <= 0;p_c[0] <= 0;p_c[1] <= 0;p_c[2] <= 0;p_c[3] <= 0;...endelse if(en && we)case(address[8:3])0:start  <= reglk_ctrl_i[1] ? start  : wdata[0];1:p_c[3] <= reglk_ctrl_i[3] ? p_c[3] : wdata[31:0];2:p_c[2] <= reglk_ctrl_i[3] ? p_c[2] : wdata[31:0];3:p_c[1] <= reglk_ctrl_i[3] ? p_c[1] : wdata[31:0];4:p_c[0] <= reglk_ctrl_i[3] ? p_c[0] : wdata[31:0];...endcaseend // always @ (posedge wb_clk_i)endmoduleThe above code snippet [REF-1402] illustrates an instance of a vulnerable implementation of the AES wrapper module, where p_c[i] registers are cleared at reset. Otherwise, p_c[i]registers either maintain their old values (if reglk_ctrl_i[3]is true) or get filled through the AXI signal wdata. Note that p_c[i]registers can be read through the AXI Lite interface (not shown in snippet). However, p_c[i] registers are never cleared after their usage once the AES engine has completed the encryption process of the message. In a multi-user or multi-process environment, not clearing registers may result in the attacker process accessing data left by the victim, leading to data leakage or unintentional information disclosure.To fix this issue, it is essential to ensure that these internal registers are cleared in a timely manner after their usage, i.e., the encryption process is complete. This is illustrated below by monitoring the assertion of the cipher text valid signal, ct_valid [REF-1403].(good code)Example Language:Verilogmodule aes0_wrapper #(...)(...);...always @(posedge clk_i)beginif(~(rst_ni && ~rst_1)) //clear p_c[i] at reset...else if(ct_valid) //encryption process complete, clear p_c[i]beginp_c[0] <= 0;p_c[1] <= 0;p_c[2] <= 0;p_c[3] <= 0;endelse if(en && we)case(address[8:3])...endcaseend // always @ (posedge wb_clk_i)endmodule\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2019-3733Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before releaseCVE-2003-0001Ethernet NIC drivers do not pad frames with null bytes, leading to infoleak from malformed packets.CVE-2003-0291router does not clear information from DHCP packets that have been previously usedCVE-2005-1406Products do not fully clear memory buffers when less data is stored into the buffer than previous.CVE-2005-1858Products do not fully clear memory buffers when less data is stored into the buffer than previous.CVE-2005-3180Products do not fully clear memory buffers when less data is stored into the buffer than previous.CVE-2005-3276Product does not clear a data structure before writing to part of it, yielding information leak of previously used memory.CVE-2002-2077Memory not properly cleared before reuse.\",\n    \"References\": \"[REF-1402] \\\"aes0_wrapper.sv\\\". 2021. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<https://github.com/HACK-EVENT/hackatdac21/blob/65d0ffdab7426da4509c98d62e163bcce642f651/piton/design/chip/tile/ariane/src/aes0/aes0_wrapper.sv#L84C2-L90C29>>.URL validated: 2024-02-14.[REF-1403] \\\"Fix for aes0_wrapper\\\". 2023-11-29. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<https://github.com/HACK-EVENT/hackatdac21/blob/0034dff6852365a8c4e36590a47ea8b088d725ae/piton/design/chip/tile/ariane/src/aes0/aes0_wrapper.sv#L96C1-L102C16>.URL validated: 2024-02-14.\",\n    \"Content History\": \"SubmissionsSubmission DateSubmitterOrganization2006-07-19(CWE Draft 3, 2006-07-19)PLOVERContributionsContribution DateContributorOrganization2023-11-29(CWE 4.14, 2024-02-29)Rahul Kande, Chen Chen, Jeyavijayan RajendranTexas A&M Universitysuggested demonstrative example2023-11-29(CWE 4.14, 2024-02-29)Mohamadreza Rostami, Shaza Zeitouni, Ahmad-Reza SadeghiTechnical University of Darmstadtsuggested demonstrative exampleModificationsModification DateModifierOrganization2008-07-01Eric DalciCigitalupdated Time_of_Introduction2008-09-08CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Relationships, Other_Notes, Relationship_Notes, Taxonomy_Mappings, Weakness_Ordinalities2008-10-14CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Relationships2008-11-24CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Relationships, Taxonomy_Mappings2009-03-10CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Relationships2009-05-27CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Relationships2009-10-29CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Description, Other_Notes2010-02-16CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Applicable_Platforms, Maintenance_Notes, Relationship_Notes2010-09-27CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Relationships2010-12-13CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Description2011-06-01CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Common_Consequences, Relationships, Taxonomy_Mappings2011-09-13CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Relationships, Taxonomy_Mappings2012-05-11CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Relationships, Taxonomy_Mappings2014-07-30CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Relationships, Taxonomy_Mappings2017-11-08CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Causal_Nature, Functional_Areas, Relationships, Taxonomy_Mappings2020-02-24CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Applicable_Platforms, Description, Name, Relationships, Time_of_Introduction, Weakness_Ordinalities2020-08-20CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Description, Name, Related_Attack_Patterns, Relationships2021-10-28CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Demonstrative_Examples, Description, Detection_Factors, Maintenance_Notes, Potential_Mitigations, Relationships, Research_Gaps2023-04-27CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Detection_Factors, Relationships, Time_of_Introduction2023-06-29CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Mapping_Notes2024-02-29(CWE 4.14, 2024-02-29)CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Demonstrative_Examples, Observed_Examples, ReferencesPrevious Entry NamesChange DatePrevious Entry Name2008-04-11Sensitive Information Uncleared Before Use2020-02-24Sensitive Information Uncleared Before Release2020-08-20Sensitive Information Uncleared in Resource Before Release for Reuse\",\n    \"Previous Entry Names\": \"Change DatePrevious Entry Name\\n\\n2008-04-11Sensitive Information Uncleared Before Use\\n\\n\\n\\n2020-02-24Sensitive Information Uncleared Before Release\\n\\n\\n\\n2020-08-20Sensitive Information Uncleared in Resource Before Release for Reuse\\n\\n\"\n}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n    \"Potential Mitigations\": \"Phases:  Architecture and Design;

An if statement is used to determine if the strings are equivalent.(bad code)Example Language:JavaString str1 = new String(\\\"Hello\\\");String str2 = new String(\\\"Hello\\\");if (str1 == str2) {System.out.println(\\\"str1 == str2\\\");}However, the if statement will not be executed as the strings are compared using the \\\"==\\\" operator. For Java objects, such as String objects, the \\\"==\\\" operator compares object references, not object values. While the two String objects above contain the same string values, they refer to different object references, so the System.out.println statement will not be executed. To compare object values, the previous code could be modified to use the equals method:(good code)if (str1.equals(str2)) {System.out.println(\\\"str1 equals str2\\\");}Example 2In the example below, three JavaScript variables are declared and initialized with the same values. Note that JavaScript will change a value between numeric and string as needed, which is the reason an integer is included with the strings. An if statement is used to determine whether the values are the same.(bad code)Example Language:JavaScript<p id=\\\"ieq3s1\\\" type=\\\"text\\\">(i === s1) is FALSE</p><p id=\\\"s4eq3i\\\" type=\\\"text\\\">(s4 === i) is FALSE</p><p id=\\\"s4eq3s1\\\" type=\\\"text\\\">(s4 === s1) is FALSE</p>var i = 65;var s1 = '65';var s4 = new String('65');if (i === s1){document.getElementById(\\\"ieq3s1\\\").innerHTML = \\\"(i === s1) is TRUE\\\";}if (s4 === i){document.getElementById(\\\"s4eq3i\\\").innerHTML = \\\"(s4 === i) is TRUE\\\";}if (s4 === s1){document.getElementById(\\\"s4eq3s1\\\").innerHTML = \\\"(s4 === s1) is TRUE\\\";}However, the body of the if statement will not be executed, as the \\\"===\\\" compares both the type of the variable AND the value. As the types of the first comparison are number and string, it fails. The types in the second are int and reference, so this one fails as well. The types in the third are reference and string, so it also fails.While the variables above contain the same values, they are contained in different types, so the document.getElementById... statement will not be executed in any of the cases.To compare object values, the previous code is modified and shown below to use the \\\"==\\\" for value comparison so the comparison in this example executes the HTML statement:(good code)Example Language:JavaScript<p id=\\\"ieq2s1\\\" type=\\\"text\\\">(i == s1) is FALSE</p><p id=\\\"s4eq2i\\\" type=\\\"text\\\">(s4 == i) is FALSE</p><p id=\\\"s4eq2s1\\\" type=\\\"text\\\">(s4 == s1) is FALSE</p>var i = 65;var s1 = '65';var s4 = new String('65');if (i == s1){document.getElementById(\\\"ieq2s1\\\").innerHTML = \\\"(i == s1) is TRUE\\\";}if (s4 == i){document.getElementById(\\\"s4eq2i\\\").innerHTML = \\\"(s4 == i) is TRUE\\\";}if (s4 == s1){document.getElementById(\\\"s4eq2s1\\\").innerHTML = \\\"(s4 == s1) is TRUE\\\";}Example 3In the example below, two PHP variables are declared and initialized with the same numbers - one as a string, the other as an integer. Note that PHP will change the string value to a number for a comparison. An if statement is used to determine whether the values are the same.(bad code)Example Language:PHPvar $i = 65;var $s1 = \\\"65\\\";if ($i === $s1){echo '($i === $s1) is TRUE'. \\\"\\\\n\\\";}else{echo '($i === $s1) is FALSE'. \\\"\\\\n\\\";}However, the body of the if statement will not be executed, as the \\\"===\\\" compares both the type of the variable AND the value. As the types of the first comparison are number and string, it fails.While the variables above contain the same values, they are contained in different types, so the TRUE portion of the if statement will not be executed.To compare object values, the previous code is modified and shown below to use the \\\"==\\\" for value comparison (string converted to number) so the comparison in this example executes the TRUE statement:(good code)Example Language:PHPvar $i = 65;var $s1 = \\\"65\\\";if ($i == $s1){echo '($i == $s1) is TRUE'. \\\"\\\\n\\\";}else{echo '($i == $s1) is FALSE'. \\\"\\\\n\\\";}\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"N/A\",\n    \"References\": \"[REF-62] Mark Dowd, John McDonald\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand Justin Schuh. \\\"The Art of Software Security Assessment\\\".

This infinite loop will consume system resources and can be used to create a denial of service attack. To resolve this a counter should be used to limit the number of attempts to establish a connection to the server, as in the following code.(good code)Example Language:Cint processMessagesFromServer(char *hostaddr, int port) {...// initialize number of attempts counterint count = 0;do {// establish connection to serverconnected = connect(servsock, (struct sockaddr *)&servaddr, sizeof(servaddr));// increment countercount++;// if connected then read and process messages from serverif (connected > -1) {// read and process messages...}// keep trying to establish connection to the server// up to a maximum number of attempts} while (connected < 0 && count < MAX_ATTEMPTS);// close socket and return success or failure...}Example 2For this example, the method isReorderNeeded is part of a bookstore application that determines if a particular book needs to be reordered based on the current inventory count and the rate at which the book is being sold.(bad code)Example Language:Javapublic boolean isReorderNeeded(String bookISBN, int rateSold) {boolean isReorder = false;int minimumCount = 10;int days = 0;// get inventory count for bookint inventoryCount = inventory.getIventoryCount(bookISBN);// find number of days until inventory count reaches minimumwhile (inventoryCount > minimumCount) {inventoryCount = inventoryCount - rateSold;days++;}// if number of days within reorder timeframe// set reorder return boolean to trueif (days > 0 && days < 5) {isReorder = true;}return isReorder;}However, the while loop will become an infinite loop if the rateSold input parameter has a value of zero since the inventoryCount will never fall below the minimumCount. In this case the input parameter should be validated to ensure that a value of zero does not cause an infinite loop, as in the following code.(good code)Example Language:Javapublic boolean isReorderNeeded(String bookISBN, int rateSold) {...// validate rateSold variableif (rateSold < 1) {return isReorder;}...}\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2022-22224Chain: an operating system does not properly process malformed Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Type/Length/Value Identifiers (TLV) (CWE-703), which can cause the process to enter an infinite loop (CWE-835)CVE-2022-25304A Python machine communication platform did not account for receiving a malformed packet with a null size, causing the receiving function to never update the message buffer and be caught in an infinite loop.CVE-2011-1027Chain: off-by-one error (CWE-193) leads to infinite loop (CWE-835) using invalid hex-encoded characters.CVE-2011-1142Chain: self-referential values in recursive definitions lead to infinite loop.CVE-2011-1002NULL UDP packet is never cleared from a queue, leading to infinite loop.CVE-2006-6499Chain: web browser crashes due to infinite loop - \\\"bad looping logic [that relies on] floating point math [CWE-1339] to exit the loop [CWE-835]\\\"CVE-2010-4476Floating point conversion routine cycles back and forth between two different values.CVE-2010-4645Floating point conversion routine cycles back and forth between two different values.CVE-2010-2534Chain: improperly clearing a pointer in a linked list leads to infinite loop.CVE-2013-1591Chain: an integer overflow (CWE-190) in the image size calculation causes an infinite loop (CWE-835) which sequentially allocates buffers without limits (CWE-1325) until the stack is full.CVE-2008-3688Chain: A denial of service may be caused by an uninitialized variable (CWE-457) allowing an infinite loop (CWE-835) resulting from a connection to an unresponsive server.\",\n    \"References\": \"[REF-62] Mark Dowd, John McDonald\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand Justin Schuh. \\\"The Art of Software Security Assessment\\\".

If they are valid, the method will update the product inventory, the user account, and the user order appropriately.(bad code)Example Language:Javapublic void updateUserAccountOrder(String productNumber, String accountNumber) {boolean isValidProduct = false;boolean isValidAccount = false;if (validProductNumber(productNumber)) {isValidProduct = true;updateInventory(productNumber);}else {return;}if (validAccountNumber(accountNumber)) {isValidProduct = true;updateAccount(accountNumber, productNumber);}if (isValidProduct && isValidAccount) {updateAccountOrder(accountNumber, productNumber);}}However, the method never sets the isValidAccount variable after initializing it to false so the isValidProduct is mistakenly used twice. The result is that the expression \\\"isValidProduct && isValidAccount\\\" will always evaluate to false, so the updateAccountOrder() method will never be invoked. This will create serious problems with the product ordering application since the user account and inventory databases will be updated but the order will not be updated.This can be easily corrected by updating the appropriate variable.(good code)...if (validAccountNumber(accountNumber)) {isValidAccount = true;updateAccount(accountNumber, productNumber);}...Example 2In the following example, the hasReadWriteAccess method uses bit masks and bit operators to determine if a user has read and write privileges for a particular process. The variable mask is defined as a bit mask from the BIT_READ and BIT_WRITE constants that have been defined. The variable mask is used within the predicate of the hasReadWriteAccess method to determine if the userMask input parameter has the read and write bits set.(bad code)Example Language:C#define BIT_READ 0x0001 // 00000001#define BIT_WRITE 0x0010 // 00010000unsigned int mask = BIT_READ & BIT_WRITE; /* intended to use \\\"|\\\" */// using \\\"&\\\", mask = 00000000// using \\\"|\\\", mask = 00010001// determine if user has read and write accessint hasReadWriteAccess(unsigned int userMask) {// if the userMask has read and write bits set// then return 1 (true)if (userMask & mask) {return 1;}// otherwise return 0 (false)return 0;}However the bit operator used to initialize the mask variable is the AND operator rather than the intended OR operator (CWE-480), this resulted in the variable mask being set to 0. As a result, the if statement will always evaluate to false and never get executed.The use of bit masks, bit operators and bitwise operations on variables can be difficult. If possible, try to use frameworks or libraries that provide appropriate functionality and abstract the implementation.Example 3In the following example, the updateInventory method used within an e-business inventory application will update the inventory for a particular product. This method includes an if statement with an expression that will always evaluate to false. This is a common practice in C/C++ to introduce debugging statements quickly by simply changing the expression to evaluate to true and then removing those debugging statements by changing expression to evaluate to false. This is also a common practice for disabling features no longer needed.(bad code)Example Language:Cint updateInventory(char* productNumber, int numberOfItems) {int initCount = getProductCount(productNumber);int updatedCount = initCount + numberOfItems;int updated = updateProductCount(updatedCount);// if statement for debugging purposes onlyif (1 == 0) {char productName[128];productName = getProductName(productNumber);printf(\\\"product %s initially has %d items in inventory \\\\n\\\", productName, initCount);printf(\\\"adding %d items to inventory for %s \\\\n\\\", numberOfItems, productName);if (updated == 0) {printf(\\\"Inventory updated for product %s to %d items \\\\n\\\", productName, updatedCount);}else {printf(\\\"Inventory not updated for product: %s \\\\n\\\", productName);}}return updated;}Using this practice for introducing debugging statements or disabling features creates dead code that can cause problems during code maintenance and potentially introduce vulnerabilities. To avoid using expressions that evaluate to false for debugging purposes a logging API or debugging API should be used for the output of debugging messages.\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"N/A\",\n    \"References\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Content History\": \"SubmissionsSubmission DateSubmitterOrganization2006-12-15(CWE Draft 5, 2006-12-15)CWE CommunitySubmitted by members of the CWE community to extend early CWE versionsModificationsModification DateModifierOrganization2008-07-01Eric DalciCigitalupdated Potential_Mitigations, Time_of_Introduction2008-09-08CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Relationships, Other_Notes2008-11-24CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Relationships, Taxonomy_Mappings2009-07-27CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Demonstrative_Examples, Other_Notes, Potential_Mitigations2009-10-29CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Demonstrative_Examples2011-06-01CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Common_Consequences2011-06-27CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Common_Consequences2011-09-13CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Relationships, Taxonomy_Mappings2012-05-11CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Relationships2014-07-30CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Relationships, Taxonomy_Mappings2017-11-08CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Applicable_Platforms, Demonstrative_Examples, Relationships, Taxonomy_Mappings2020-02-24CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Relationships, Type2020-08-20CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Relationships2023-01-31CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Description2023-04-27CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Detection_Factors, Relationships2023-06-29CWE Content TeamMITREupdated Mapping_Notes\",\n    \"Previous Entry Names\": \"N/A\"\n}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n    \"Potential Mitigations\": \"Phase:  TestingUse Static Analysis tools to spot such conditions.\",\n    \"Weakness Ordinalities\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Detection Methods\": \"Automated Static AnalysisAutomated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.

As a result, the strncmp() call only checks the first four characters of the input password, resulting in a partial comparison (CWE-187), leading to improper authentication (CWE-287).Because of the partial comparison, any of these passwords would still cause authentication to succeed for the \\\"admin\\\" user:(attack code)pass5passABCDEFGHpassWORDBecause only 4 characters are checked, this significantly reduces the search space for an attacker, making brute force attacks more feasible.The same problem also applies to the username, so values such as \\\"adminXYZ\\\" and \\\"administrator\\\" will succeed for the username.\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"N/A\",\n    \"References\": \"[REF-18] Secure Software, Inc.. \\\"The CLASP Application Security Process\\\". 2005. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<https://cwe.mitre.org/documents/sources/TheCLASPApplicationSecurityProcess.pdf>.[REF-442] Robert Seacord. \\\"EXP01-A.

Use an appropriate combination of denylists and allowlists to ensure only valid, expected and appropriate input is processed by the system.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Input ValidationAssume all input is malicious. Use an \\\"accept known good\\\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \\\"boat\\\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \\\"red\\\" or \\\"blue.\\\"Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Output EncodingWhile it is risky to use dynamically-generated query strings, code, or commands that mix control and data together, sometimes it may be unavoidable. Properly quote arguments and escape any special characters within those arguments. The most conservative approach is to escape or filter all characters that do not pass an extremely strict allowlist (such as everything that is not alphanumeric or white space). If some special characters are still needed, such as white space, wrap each argument in quotes after the escaping/filtering step. Be careful of argument injection (CWE-88).\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Input ValidationInputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180).

The back-end is legacy code that does not perform authentication or authorization, so the front-end must implement it. The chat protocol supports two commands, SAY and BAN, although only administrators can use the BAN command. Each argument must be separated by a single space. The raw inputs are URL-encoded. The messaging protocol allows multiple commands to be specified on the same line if they are separated by a \\\"|\\\" character.First let's look at the back end command processor code(bad code)Example Language:Perl$inputString = readLineFromFileHandle($serverFH);# generate an array of strings separated by the \\\"|\\\" character.@commands = split(/\\\\|/, $inputString);foreach $cmd (@commands) {# separate the operator from its arguments based on a single whitespace($operator, $args) = split(/ /, $cmd, 2);$args = UrlDecode($args);if ($operator eq \\\"BAN\\\") {ExecuteBan($args);}elsif ($operator eq \\\"SAY\\\") {ExecuteSay($args);}}The front end web application receives a command, encodes it for sending to the server, performs the authorization check, and sends the command to the server.(bad code)Example Language:Perl$inputString = GetUntrustedArgument(\\\"command\\\");($cmd, $argstr) = split(/\\\\s+/, $inputString, 2);# removes extra whitespace and also changes CRLF's to spaces$argstr =~ s/\\\\s+/ /gs;$argstr = UrlEncode($argstr);if (($cmd eq \\\"BAN\\\") && (! IsAdministrator($username))) {die \\\"Error: you are not the admin.\\\\n\\\";}# communicate with file server using a file handle$fh = GetServerFileHandle(\\\"myserver\\\");print $fh \\\"$cmd $argstr\\\\n\\\";It is clear that, while the protocol and back-end allow multiple commands to be sent in a single request, the front end only intends to send a single command. However, the UrlEncode function could leave the \\\"|\\\" character intact. If an attacker provides:(attack code)SAY hello world|BAN user12then the front end will see this is a \\\"SAY\\\" command, and the $argstr will look like \\\"hello world | BAN user12\\\". Since the command is \\\"SAY\\\", the check for the \\\"BAN\\\" command will fail, and the front end will send the URL-encoded command to the back end:(result)SAY hello%20world|BAN%20user12The back end, however, will treat these as two separate commands:(result)SAY hello worldBAN user12Notice, however, that if the front end properly encodes the \\\"|\\\" with \\\"%7C\\\", then the back end will only process a single command.Example 3This example takes user input, passes it through an encoding scheme and then creates a directory specified by the user.(bad code)Example Language:Perlsub GetUntrustedInput {return($ARGV[0]);}sub encode {my($str) = @_;$str =~ s/\\\\&/\\\\&amp;/gs;$str =~ s/\\\\\\\"/\\\\&quot;/gs;$str =~ s/\\\\'/\\\\&apos;/gs;$str =~ s/\\\\</\\\\&lt;/gs;$str =~ s/\\\\>/\\\\&gt;/gs;return($str);}sub doit {my $uname = encode(GetUntrustedInput(\\\"username\\\"));print \\\"<b>Welcome, $uname!</b><p>\\\\n\\\";system(\\\"cd /home/$uname; /bin/ls -l\\\");}The programmer attempts to encode dangerous characters, however the denylist for encoding is incomplete (CWE-184) and an attacker can still pass a semicolon, resulting in a chain with command injection (CWE-77).Additionally, the encoding routine is used inappropriately with command execution. An attacker doesn't even need to insert their own semicolon. The attacker can instead leverage the encoding routine to provide the semicolon to separate the commands. If an attacker supplies a string of the form:(attack code)' pwdthen the program will encode the apostrophe and insert the semicolon, which functions as a command separator when passed to the system function. This allows the attacker to complete the command injection.\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2021-41232Chain: authentication routine in Go-based agile development product does not escape user name (CWE-116), allowing LDAP injection (CWE-90)CVE-2008-4636OS command injection in backup software using shell metacharacters in a filename; correct behavior would require that this filename could not be changed.CVE-2008-0769Web application does not set the charset when sending a page to a browser, allowing for XSS exploitation when a browser chooses an unexpected encoding.CVE-2008-0005Program does not set the charset when sending a page to a browser, allowing for XSS exploitation when a browser chooses an unexpected encoding.CVE-2008-5573SQL injection via password parameter; a strong password might contain \\\"&\\\"CVE-2008-3773Cross-site scripting in chat application via a message subject, which normally might contain \\\"&\\\" and other XSS-related characters.CVE-2008-0757Cross-site scripting in chat application via a message, which normally might be allowed to contain arbitrary content.\",\n    \"References\": \"[REF-45] OWASP. \\\"OWASP Enterprise Security API (ESAPI) Project\\\". <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/ESAPI>.[REF-46] Joshbw. \\\"Output Sanitization\\\". 2008-09-18. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<https://web.archive.org/web/20081208054333/http://analyticalengine.net/archives/58>.URL validated: 2023-04-07.[REF-47] Niyaz PK. \\\"Sanitizing user data: How and where to do it\\\". 2008-09-11. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<https://web.archive.org/web/20090105222005/http://www.diovo.com/2008/09/sanitizing-user-data-how-and-where-to-do-it/>.URL validated: 2023-04-07.[REF-48] Jeremiah Grossman. \\\"Input validation or output filtering, which is better?\\\". 2007-01-30. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<https://blog.jeremiahgrossman.com/2007/01/input-validation-or-output-filtering.html>.URL validated: 2023-04-07.[REF-49] Jim Manico. \\\"Input Validation - Not That Important\\\". 2008-08-10. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<https://manicode.blogspot.com/2008/08/input-validation-not-that-important.html>.URL validated: 2023-04-07.[REF-50] Michael Eddington. \\\"Preventing XSS with Correct Output Encoding\\\". <http://phed.org/2008/05/19/preventing-xss-with-correct-output-encoding/>.[REF-7] Michael Howard and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDavid LeBlanc. \\\"Writing Secure Code\\\".

These will help the programmer encode outputs in a manner less prone to error.Alternately, use built-in functions, but consider using wrappers in case those functions are discovered to have a vulnerability.\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignStrategy:  ParameterizationIf available, use structured mechanisms that automatically enforce the separation between data and code. These mechanisms may be able to provide the relevant quoting, encoding, and validation automatically, instead of relying on the developer to provide this capability at every point where output is generated.For example, stored procedures can enforce database query structure and reduce the likelihood of SQL injection.\\n\\nPhases:  Architecture and Design; ImplementationUnderstand the context in which your data will be used and the encoding that will be expected. This is especially important when transmitting data between different components, or when generating outputs that can contain multiple encodings at the same time, such as web pages or multi-part mail messages. Study all expected communication protocols and data representations to determine the required encoding strategies.\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignIn some cases, input validation may be an important strategy when output encoding is not a complete solution. For example, you may be providing the same output that will be processed by multiple consumers that use different encodings or representations. In other cases, you may be required to allow user-supplied input to contain control information, such as limited HTML tags that support formatting in a wiki or bulletin board. When this type of requirement must be met, use an extremely strict allowlist to limit which control sequences can be used. Verify that the resulting syntactic structure is what you expect. Use your normal encoding methods for the remainder of the input.\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignUse input validation as a defense-in-depth measure to reduce the likelihood of output encoding errors (seeCWE-20).\\n\\nPhase:  RequirementsFully specify which encodings are required by components that will be communicating with each other.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationWhen exchanging data between components, ensure that both components are using the same character encoding.

For example, by validating that a numeric ID field should only contain the 0-9 characters, the programmer effectively prevents injection attacks.However, input validation is not always sufficient, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a last name is inserted into a query. The name \\\"O'Reilly\\\" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, it cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the \\\"'\\\" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise neutralized. In this case, stripping the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.TerminologyThe usage of the \\\"encoding\\\" and \\\"escaping\\\" terms varies widely. For example, in some programming languages, the terms are used interchangeably, while other languages provide APIs that use both terms for different tasks. This overlapping usage extends to the Web, such as the \\\"escape\\\" JavaScript function whose purpose is stated to be encoding. The concepts of encoding and escaping predate the Web by decades. Given such a context, it is difficult for CWE to adopt a consistent vocabulary that will not be misinterpreted by some constituency.TheoreticalThis is a data/directive boundary error in which data boundaries are not sufficiently enforced before it is sent to a different control sphere.Research GapWhile many published vulnerabilities are related to insufficient output encoding, there is such an emphasis on input validation as a protection mechanism that the underlying causes are rarely described. Within CVE, the focus is primarily on well-understood issues like cross-site scripting and SQL injection. It is likely that this weakness frequently occurs in custom protocols that support multiple encodings, which are not necessarily detectable with automated techniques.\",\n    \"Taxonomy Mappings\": \"Mapped Taxonomy NameNode IDFitMapped Node NameWASC22Improper Output HandlingThe CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011)IDS00-JExactSanitize untrusted data passed across a trust boundaryThe CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011)IDS05-JUse a subset of ASCII for file and path namesSEI CERT Oracle Coding Standard for JavaIDS00-JImprecisePrevent SQL injectionSEI CERT Perl Coding StandardIDS33-PLExactSanitize untrusted data passed across a trust boundary\",\n    \"Related Attack Patterns\": \"CAPEC-IDAttack Pattern NameCAPEC-104Cross Zone ScriptingCAPEC-73User-Controlled FilenameCAPEC-81Web Server Logs TamperingCAPEC-85AJAX Footprinting\"\n}"}]}

But if an I/O error occurs, fgets() will not null-terminate buf. Furthermore, if the end of the file is reached before any characters are read, fgets() returns without writing anything to buf. In both of these situations, fgets() signals that something unusual has happened by returning NULL, but in this code, the warning will not be noticed. The lack of a null terminator in buf can result in a buffer overflow in the subsequent call to strcpy().Example 2In the following example, it is possible to request that memcpy move a much larger segment of memory than assumed:(bad code)Example Language:Cint returnChunkSize(void *) {/* if chunk info is valid, return the size of usable memory,* else, return -1 to indicate an error*/...}int main() {...memcpy(destBuf, srcBuf, (returnChunkSize(destBuf)-1));...}If returnChunkSize() happens to encounter an error it will return -1. Notice that the return value is not checked before the memcpy operation (CWE-252), so -1 can be passed as the size argument to memcpy() (CWE-805). Because memcpy() assumes that the value is unsigned, it will be interpreted as MAXINT-1 (CWE-195), and therefore will copy far more memory than is likely available to the destination buffer (CWE-787,CWE-788).Example 3The following code does not check to see if memory allocation succeeded before attempting to use the pointer returned by malloc().(bad code)Example Language:Cbuf = (char*) malloc(req_size);strncpy(buf, xfer, req_size);The traditional defense of this coding error is: \\\"If my program runs out of memory, it will fail. It doesn't matter whether I handle the error or allow the program to die with a segmentation fault when it tries to dereference the null pointer.\\\" This argument ignores three important considerations:Depending upon the type and size of the application, it may be possible to free memory that is being used elsewhere so that execution can continue.It is impossible for the program to perform a graceful exit if required. If the program is performing an atomic operation, it can leave the system in an inconsistent state.The programmer has lost the opportunity to record diagnostic information. Did the call to malloc() fail because req_size was too large or because there were too many requests being handled at the same time? Or was it caused by a memory leak that has built up over time? Without handling the error, there is no way to know.Example 4The following examples read a file into a byte array.(bad code)Example Language:C#char[] byteArray = new char[1024];for (IEnumerator i=users.GetEnumerator(); i.MoveNext() ;i.Current()) {String userName = (String) i.Current();String pFileName = PFILE_ROOT + \\\"/\\\" + userName;StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(pFileName);sr.Read(byteArray,0,1024);//the file is always 1k bytessr.Close();processPFile(userName, byteArray);}(bad code)Example Language:JavaFileInputStream fis;byte[] byteArray = new byte[1024];for (Iterator i=users.iterator(); i.hasNext();) {String userName = (String) i.next();String pFileName = PFILE_ROOT + \\\"/\\\" + userName;FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(pFileName);fis.read(byteArray); // the file is always 1k bytesfis.close();processPFile(userName, byteArray);The code loops through a set of users, reading a private data file for each user. The programmer assumes that the files are always 1 kilobyte in size and therefore ignores the return value from Read(). If an attacker can create a smaller file, the program will recycle the remainder of the data from the previous user and treat it as though it belongs to the attacker.Example 5The following code does not check to see if the string returned by getParameter() is null before calling the member function compareTo(), potentially causing a NULL dereference.(bad code)Example Language:JavaString itemName = request.getParameter(ITEM_NAME);if (itemName.compareTo(IMPORTANT_ITEM) == 0) {...}...The following code does not check to see if the string returned by the Item property is null before calling the member function Equals(), potentially causing a NULL dereference.(bad code)Example Language:JavaString itemName = request.Item(ITEM_NAME);if (itemName.Equals(IMPORTANT_ITEM)) {...}...The traditional defense of this coding error is: \\\"I know the requested value will always exist because.... If it does not exist, the program cannot perform the desired behavior so it doesn't matter whether I handle the error or allow the program to die dereferencing a null value.\\\" But attackers are skilled at finding unexpected paths through programs, particularly when exceptions are involved.Example 6The following code shows a system property that is set to null and later dereferenced by a programmer who mistakenly assumes it will always be defined.(bad code)Example Language:JavaSystem.clearProperty(\\\"os.name\\\");...String os = System.getProperty(\\\"os.name\\\");if (os.equalsIgnoreCase(\\\"Windows 95\\\")) System.out.println(\\\"Not supported\\\");The traditional defense of this coding error is: \\\"I know the requested value will always exist because.... If it does not exist, the program cannot perform the desired behavior so it doesn't matter whether I handle the error or allow the program to die dereferencing a null value.\\\" But attackers are skilled at finding unexpected paths through programs, particularly when exceptions are involved.Example 7The following VB.NET code does not check to make sure that it has read 50 bytes from myfile.txt. This can cause DoDangerousOperation() to operate on an unexpected value.(bad code)Example Language:C#Dim MyFile As New FileStream(\\\"myfile.txt\\\", FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.Read)Dim MyArray(50) As ByteMyFile.Read(MyArray, 0, 50)DoDangerousOperation(MyArray(20))In .NET, it is not uncommon for programmers to misunderstand Read() and related methods that are part of many System.IO classes. The stream and reader classes do not consider it to be unusual or exceptional if only a small amount of data becomes available. These classes simply add the small amount of data to the return buffer, and set the return value to the number of bytes or characters read. There is no guarantee that the amount of data returned is equal to the amount of data requested.Example 8It is not uncommon for Java programmers to misunderstand read() and related methods that are part of many java.io classes. Most errors and unusual events in Java result in an exception being thrown. But the stream and reader classes do not consider it unusual or exceptional if only a small amount of data becomes available. These classes simply add the small amount of data to the return buffer, and set the return value to the number of bytes or characters read. There is no guarantee that the amount of data returned is equal to the amount of data requested. This behavior makes it important for programmers to examine the return value from read() and other IO methods to ensure that they receive the amount of data they expect.Example 9This example takes an IP address from a user, verifies that it is well formed and then looks up the hostname and copies it into a buffer.(bad code)Example Language:Cvoid host_lookup(char *user_supplied_addr){struct hostent *hp;in_addr_t *addr;char hostname[64];in_addr_t inet_addr(const char *cp);/*routine that ensures user_supplied_addr is in the right format for conversion */validate_addr_form(user_supplied_addr);addr = inet_addr(user_supplied_addr);hp = gethostbyaddr( addr, sizeof(struct in_addr), AF_INET);strcpy(hostname, hp->h_name);}If an attacker provides an address that appears to be well-formed, but the address does not resolve to a hostname, then the call to gethostbyaddr() will return NULL. Since the code does not check the return value from gethostbyaddr (CWE-252), a NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476) would then occur in the call to strcpy().Note that this code is also vulnerable to a buffer overflow (CWE-119).Example 10The following function attempts to acquire a lock in order to perform operations on a shared resource.(bad code)Example Language:Cvoid f(pthread_mutex_t *mutex) {pthread_mutex_lock(mutex);/* access shared resource */pthread_mutex_unlock(mutex);}However, the code does not check the value returned by pthread_mutex_lock() for errors. If pthread_mutex_lock() cannot acquire the mutex for any reason, the function may introduce a race condition into the program and result in undefined behavior.In order to avoid data races, correctly written programs must check the result of thread synchronization functions and appropriately handle all errors, either by attempting to recover from them or reporting them to higher levels.(good code)Example Language:Cint f(pthread_mutex_t *mutex) {int result;result = pthread_mutex_lock(mutex);if (0 != result)return result;/* access shared resource */return pthread_mutex_unlock(mutex);}\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2020-17533Chain: unchecked return value (CWE-252) of some functions for policy enforcement leads to authorization bypass (CWE-862)CVE-2020-6078Chain: The return value of a function returning a pointer is not checked for success (CWE-252) resulting in the later use of an uninitialized variable (CWE-456) and a null pointer dereference (CWE-476)CVE-2019-15900Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).CVE-2007-3798Unchecked return value leads to resultant integer overflow and code execution.CVE-2006-4447Program does not check return value when invoking functions to drop privileges, which could leave users with higher privileges than expected by forcing those functions to fail.CVE-2006-2916Program does not check return value when invoking functions to drop privileges, which could leave users with higher privileges than expected by forcing those functions to fail.CVE-2008-5183chain: unchecked return value can lead to NULL dereferenceCVE-2010-0211chain: unchecked return value (CWE-252) leads to free of invalid, uninitialized pointer (CWE-824).CVE-2017-6964Linux-based device mapper encryption program does not check the return value of setuid and setgid allowing attackers to execute code with unintended privileges.CVE-2002-1372Chain: Return values of file/socket operations are not checked (CWE-252), allowing resultant consumption of file descriptors (CWE-772).\",\n    \"References\": \"[REF-6] Katrina Tsipenyuk, Brian Chess\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand Gary McGraw. \\\"Seven Pernicious Kingdoms: A Taxonomy of Software Security Errors\\\".

In a busy environment, the Operating System could use up all of the available file handles before the Close() function is called.(bad code)Example Language:Javaprivate void processFile(string fName){BufferReader fil = new BufferReader(new FileReader(fName));String line;while ((line = fil.ReadLine()) != null){processLine(line);}}The good code example simply adds an explicit call to the Close() function when the system is done using the file.

In a real system, the problem may be considerably more obscure.(good code)Example Language:Javaprivate void processFile(string fName){BufferReader fil = new BufferReader(new FileReader(fName));String line;while ((line = fil.ReadLine()) != null){processLine(line);}fil.Close();}Example 2This code attempts to open a connection to a database and catches any exceptions that may occur.(bad code)Example Language:Javatry {Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(some_connection_string);}catch ( Exception e ) {log( e );}If an exception occurs after establishing the database connection and before the same connection closes, the pool of database connections may become exhausted.

The program performs certain file operations on behalf of non-privileged users, and uses access checks to ensure that it does not use its root privileges to perform operations that should otherwise be unavailable the current user. The program uses the access() system call to check if the person running the program has permission to access the specified file before it opens the file and performs the necessary operations.(bad code)Example Language:Cif(!access(file,W_OK)) {f = fopen(file,\\\"w+\\\");operate(f);...}else {fprintf(stderr,\\\"Unable to open file %s.\\\\n\\\",file);}The call to access() behaves as expected, and returns 0 if the user running the program has the necessary permissions to write to the file, and -1 otherwise. However, because both access() and fopen() operate on filenames rather than on file handles, there is no guarantee that the file variable still refers to the same file on disk when it is passed to fopen() that it did when it was passed to access(). If an attacker replaces file after the call to access() with a symbolic link to a different file, the program will use its root privileges to operate on the file even if it is a file that the attacker would otherwise be unable to modify. By tricking the program into performing an operation that would otherwise be impermissible, the attacker has gained elevated privileges. This type of vulnerability is not limited to programs with root privileges. If the application is capable of performing any operation that the attacker would not otherwise be allowed perform, then it is a possible target.Example 3This code prints the contents of a file if a user has permission.(bad code)Example Language:PHPfunction readFile($filename){$user = getCurrentUser();//resolve file if its a symbolic linkif(is_link($filename)){$filename = readlink($filename);}if(fileowner($filename) == $user){echo file_get_contents($realFile);return;}else{echo 'Access denied';return false;}}This code attempts to resolve symbolic links before checking the file and printing its contents. However, an attacker may be able to change the file from a real file to a symbolic link between the calls to is_link() and file_get_contents(), allowing the reading of arbitrary files. Note that this code fails to log the attempted access (CWE-778).Example 4This example is adapted from [REF-18]. Assume that this code block is invoked from multiple threads. The switch statement will execute different code depending on the time when MYFILE.txt was last changed.(bad code)Example Language:C#include <sys/types.h>#include <sys/stat.h>...struct stat sb;stat(\\\"MYFILE.txt\\\",&sb);printf(\\\"file change time: %d\\\\n\\\",sb->st_ctime);switch(sb->st_ctime % 2){case 0: printf(\\\"Option 1\\\\n\\\"); break;case 1: printf(\\\"Option 2\\\\n\\\"); break;default: printf(\\\"this should be unreachable?\\\\n\\\"); break;}If this code block were executed within multiple threads, and MYFILE.txt changed between the operation of one thread and another, then the switch could produce different, possibly unexpected results.\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2015-1743TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executedCVE-2003-0813A multi-threaded race condition allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or reboot) by causing two threads to process the same RPC request, which causes one thread to use memory after it has been freed.CVE-2004-0594PHP flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by aborting execution before the initialization of key data structures is complete.CVE-2008-2958chain: time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in program allows bypass of protection mechanism that was designed to prevent symlink attacks.CVE-2008-1570chain: time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in program allows bypass of protection mechanism that was designed to prevent symlink attacks.\",\n    \"References\": \"[REF-18] Secure Software, Inc.. \\\"The CLASP Application Security Process\\\". 5.4.6 Race condition in switch. 2005. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<https://cwe.mitre.org/documents/sources/TheCLASPApplicationSecurityProcess.pdf>.[REF-367] Dan Tsafrir, Tomer Hertz, David Wagner\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand Dilma Da Silva. \\\"Portably Solving File TOCTTOU Races with Hardness Amplification\\\". 2008-02-28. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/fast08/tech/tsafrir.html>.URL validated: 2023-04-07.[REF-44] Michael Howard, David LeBlanc\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand John Viega. \\\"24 Deadly Sins of Software Security\\\". \\\"Sin 13: Race Conditions.\\\" Page 205.

If the allocated buffer is smaller than expected, this could lead to an out-of-bounds read or write (CWE-119), possibly causing a crash, allowing arbitrary code execution, or exposing sensitive data.\",\n    \"Likelihood of Exploit\": \"High\",\n    \"Demonstrative Examples\": \"Example 1The following code allocates memory for a maximum number of widgets. It then gets a user-specified number of widgets, making sure that the user does not request too many. It then initializes the elements of the array using InitializeWidget(). Because the number of widgets can vary for each request, the code inserts a NULL pointer to signify the location of the last widget.(bad code)Example Language:Cint i;unsigned int numWidgets;Widget **WidgetList;numWidgets = GetUntrustedSizeValue();if ((numWidgets == 0) || (numWidgets > MAX_NUM_WIDGETS)) {ExitError(\\\"Incorrect number of widgets requested!\\\");}WidgetList = (Widget **)malloc(numWidgets * sizeof(Widget *));printf(\\\"WidgetList ptr=%p\\\\n\\\", WidgetList);for(i=0; i<numWidgets; i++) {WidgetList[i] = InitializeWidget();}WidgetList[numWidgets] = NULL;showWidgets(WidgetList);However, this code contains an off-by-one calculation error (CWE-193). It allocates exactly enough space to contain the specified number of widgets, but it does not include the space for the NULL pointer. As a result, the allocated buffer is smaller than it is supposed to be (CWE-131). So if the user ever requests MAX_NUM_WIDGETS, there is an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) when the NULL is assigned. Depending on the environment and compilation settings, this could cause memory corruption.Example 2The following image processing code allocates a table for images.(bad code)Example Language:Cimg_t table_ptr; /*struct containing img data, 10kB each*/int num_imgs;...num_imgs = get_num_imgs();table_ptr = (img_t*)malloc(sizeof(img_t)*num_imgs);...This code intends to allocate a table of size num_imgs, however as num_imgs grows large, the calculation determining the size of the list will eventually overflow (CWE-190). This will result in a very small list to be allocated instead. If the subsequent code operates on the list as if it were num_imgs long, it may result in many types of out-of-bounds problems (CWE-119).Example 3This example applies an encoding procedure to an input string and stores it into a buffer.(bad code)Example Language:Cchar * copy_input(char *user_supplied_string){int i, dst_index;char *dst_buf = (char*)malloc(4*sizeof(char) * MAX_SIZE);if ( MAX_SIZE <= strlen(user_supplied_string) ){die(\\\"user string too long, die evil hacker!\\\");}dst_index = 0;for ( i = 0; i < strlen(user_supplied_string); i++ ){if( '&' == user_supplied_string[i] ){dst_buf[dst_index++] = '&';dst_buf[dst_index++] = 'a';dst_buf[dst_index++] = 'm';dst_buf[dst_index++] = 'p';dst_buf[dst_index++] = ';';}else if ('<' == user_supplied_string[i] ){/* encode to &lt; */}else dst_buf[dst_index++] = user_supplied_string[i];}return dst_buf;}The programmer attempts to encode the ampersand character in the user-controlled string, however the length of the string is validated before the encoding procedure is applied. Furthermore, the programmer assumes encoding expansion will only expand a given character by a factor of 4, while the encoding of the ampersand expands by 5. As a result, when the encoding procedure expands the string it is possible to overflow the destination buffer if the attacker provides a string of many ampersands.Example 4The following code is intended to read an incoming packet from a socket and extract one or more headers.(bad code)Example Language:CDataPacket *packet;int numHeaders;PacketHeader *headers;sock=AcceptSocketConnection();ReadPacket(packet, sock);numHeaders =packet->headers;if (numHeaders > 100) {ExitError(\\\"too many headers!\\\");}headers = malloc(numHeaders * sizeof(PacketHeader);ParsePacketHeaders(packet, headers);The code performs a check to make sure that the packet does not contain too many headers. However, numHeaders is defined as a signed int, so it could be negative. If the incoming packet specifies a value such as -3, then the malloc calculation will generate a negative number (say, -300 if each header can be a maximum of 100 bytes). When this result is provided to malloc(), it is first converted to a size_t type. This conversion then produces a large value such as 4294966996, which may cause malloc() to fail or to allocate an extremely large amount of memory (CWE-195). With the appropriate negative numbers, an attacker could trick malloc() into using a very small positive number, which then allocates a buffer that is much smaller than expected, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.Example 5The following code attempts to save three different identification numbers into an array. The array is allocated from memory using a call to malloc().(bad code)Example Language:Cint *id_sequence;/* Allocate space for an array of three ids. */id_sequence = (int*) malloc(3);if (id_sequence == NULL) exit(1);/* Populate the id array. */id_sequence[0] = 13579;id_sequence[1] = 24680;id_sequence[2] = 97531;The problem with the code above is the value of the size parameter used during the malloc() call. It uses a value of '3' which by definition results in a buffer of three bytes to be created. However the intention was to create a buffer that holds three ints, and in C, each int requires 4 bytes worth of memory, so an array of 12 bytes is needed, 4 bytes for each int. Executing the above code could result in a buffer overflow as 12 bytes of data is being saved into 3 bytes worth of allocated space. The overflow would occur during the assignment of id_sequence[0] and would continue with the assignment of id_sequence[1] and id_sequence[2].The malloc() call could have used '3*sizeof(int)' as the value for the size parameter in order to allocate the correct amount of space required to store the three ints.\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2020-17087Chain: integer truncation (CWE-197) causes small buffer allocation (CWE-131) leading to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) in kernel pool, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.CVE-2004-1363substitution overflow: buffer overflow using environment variables that are expanded after the length check is performedCVE-2004-0747substitution overflow: buffer overflow using expansion of environment variablesCVE-2005-2103substitution overflow: buffer overflow using a large number of substitution stringsCVE-2005-3120transformation overflow: product adds extra escape characters to incoming data, but does not account for them in the buffer lengthCVE-2003-0899transformation overflow: buffer overflow when expanding \\\">\\\" to \\\"&gt;\\\", etc.CVE-2001-0334expansion overflow: buffer overflow using wildcardsCVE-2001-0248expansion overflow: long pathname + glob = overflowCVE-2001-0249expansion overflow: long pathname + glob = overflowCVE-2002-0184special characters in argument are not properly expandedCVE-2004-0434small length value leads to heap overflowCVE-2002-1347multiple variantsCVE-2005-0490needs closer investigation, but probably expansion-basedCVE-2004-0940needs closer investigation, but probably expansion-basedCVE-2008-0599Chain: Language interpreter calculates wrong buffer size (CWE-131) by using \\\"size = ptr ?

For example, in a routine that converts \\\"&\\\" characters to \\\"&amp;\\\" for HTML entity encoding, the output buffer needs to be at least 5 times as large as the input buffer.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationUnderstand the programming language's underlying representation and how it interacts with numeric calculation (CWE-681). Pay close attention to byte size discrepancies, precision, signed/unsigned distinctions, truncation, conversion and casting between types, \\\"not-a-number\\\" calculations, and how the language handles numbers that are too large or too small for its underlying representation. [REF-7]Also be careful to account for 32-bit, 64-bit, and other potential differences that may affect the numeric representation.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Input ValidationPerform input validation on any numeric input by ensuring that it is within the expected range. Enforce that the input meets both the minimum and maximum requirements for the expected range.\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignFor any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoidCWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationWhen processing structured incoming data containing a size field followed by raw data, identify and resolve any inconsistencies between the size field and the actual size of the data (CWE-130).\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationWhen allocating memory that uses sentinels to mark the end of a data structure - such as NUL bytes in strings - make sure you also include the sentinel in your calculation of the total amount of memory that must be allocated.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationReplace unbounded copy functions with analogous functions that support length arguments, such as strcpy with strncpy. Create these if they are not available.Effectiveness: ModerateNote:This approach is still susceptible to calculation errors, including issues such as off-by-one errors (CWE-193) and incorrectly calculating buffer lengths (CWE-131). Additionally, this only addresses potential overflow issues. Resource consumption / exhaustion issues are still possible.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationUse sizeof() on the appropriate data type to avoidCWE-467.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationUse the appropriate type for the desired action. For example, in C/C++, only use unsigned types for values that could never be negative, such as height, width, or other numbers related to quantity. This will simplify validation and will reduce surprises related to unexpected casting.\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignStrategy:  Libraries or FrameworksUse a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.Use libraries or frameworks that make it easier to handle numbers without unexpected consequences, or buffer allocation routines that automatically track buffer size.Examples include safe integer handling packages such as SafeInt (C++) or IntegerLib (C or C++). [REF-106]\\n\\nPhases:  Operation; Build and CompilationStrategy:  Environment HardeningUse automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking.D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail.Effectiveness: Defense in DepthNote:This is not necessarily a complete solution, since these mechanisms only detect certain types of overflows. In addition, the result is still a denial of service, since the typical response is to exit the application.\\n\\nPhases:  Operation; Build and CompilationStrategy:  Environment HardeningRun or compile the software using features or extensions that randomly arrange the positions of a program's executable and libraries in memory. Because this makes the addresses unpredictable, it can prevent an attacker from reliably jumping to exploitable code.Examples include Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) [REF-58] [REF-60] and Position-Independent Executables (PIE) [REF-64]. Imported modules may be similarly realigned if their default memory addresses conflict with other modules, in a process known as \\\"rebasing\\\" (for Windows) and \\\"prelinking\\\" (for Linux) [REF-1332] using randomly generated addresses. ASLR for libraries cannot be used in conjunction with prelink since it would require relocating the libraries at run-time, defeating the whole purpose of prelinking.For more information on these techniques see D3-SAOR (Segment Address Offset Randomization) from D3FEND [REF-1335].Effectiveness: Defense in DepthNote:These techniques do not provide a complete solution. For instance, exploits frequently use a bug that discloses memory addresses in order to maximize reliability of code execution [REF-1337]. It has also been shown that a side-channel attack can bypass ASLR [REF-1333]\\n\\nPhase:  OperationStrategy:  Environment HardeningUse a CPU and operating system that offers Data Execution Protection (using hardware NX or XD bits) or the equivalent techniques that simulate this feature in software, such as PaX [REF-60] [REF-61]. These techniques ensure that any instruction executed is exclusively at a memory address that is part of the code segment.For more information on these techniques see D3-PSEP (Process Segment Execution Prevention) from D3FEND [REF-1336].Effectiveness: Defense in DepthNote:This is not a complete solution, since buffer overflows could be used to overwrite nearby variables to modify the software's state in dangerous ways. In addition, it cannot be used in cases in which self-modifying code is required. Finally, an attack could still cause a denial of service, since the typical response is to exit the application.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Compilation or Build HardeningExamine compiler warnings closely and eliminate problems with potential security implications, such as signed / unsigned mismatch in memory operations, or use of uninitialized variables. Even if the weakness is rarely exploitable, a single failure may lead to the compromise of the entire system.\\n\\nPhases:  Architecture and Design; OperationStrategy:  Environment HardeningRun your code using the lowest privileges that are required to accomplish the necessary tasks [REF-76]. If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a single task. That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.\\n\\nPhases:  Architecture and Design; OperationStrategy:  Sandbox or JailRun the code in a \\\"jail\\\" or similar sandbox environment that enforces strict boundaries between the process and the operating system. This may effectively restrict which files can be accessed in a particular directory or which commands can be executed by the software.OS-level examples include the Unix chroot jail, AppArmor, and SELinux. In general, managed code may provide some protection. For example, java.io.FilePermission in the Java SecurityManager allows the software to specify restrictions on file operations.This may not be a feasible solution, and it only limits the impact to the operating system; the rest of the application may still be subject to compromise.Be careful to avoidCWE-243and other weaknesses related to jails.Effectiveness: LimitedNote:The effectiveness of this mitigation depends on the prevention capabilities of the specific sandbox or jail being used and might only help to reduce the scope of an attack, such as restricting the attacker to certain system calls or limiting the portion of the file system that can be accessed.\",\n    \"Weakness Ordinalities\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Detection Methods\": \"Automated Static AnalysisThis weakness can often be detected using automated static analysis tools. Many modern tools use data flow analysis or constraint-based techniques to minimize the number of false positives.Automated static analysis generally does not account for environmental considerations when reporting potential errors in buffer calculations. This can make it difficult for users to determine which warnings should be investigated first. For example, an analysis tool might report buffer overflows that originate from command line arguments in a program that is not expected to run with setuid or other special privileges.Effectiveness: HighNote:Detection techniques for buffer-related errors are more mature than for most other weakness types.Automated Dynamic AnalysisThis weakness can be detected using dynamic tools and techniques that interact with the software using large test suites with many diverse inputs, such as fuzz testing (fuzzing), robustness testing, and fault injection. The software's operation may slow down, but it should not become unstable, crash, or generate incorrect results.Effectiveness: ModerateNote:Without visibility into the code, black box methods may not be able to sufficiently distinguish this weakness from others, requiring follow-up manual methods to diagnose the underlying problem.Manual AnalysisManual analysis can be useful for finding this weakness, but it might not achieve desired code coverage within limited time constraints. This becomes difficult for weaknesses that must be considered for all inputs, since the attack surface can be too large.Manual AnalysisThis weakness can be detected using tools and techniques that require manual (human) analysis, such as penetration testing, threat modeling, and interactive tools that allow the tester to record and modify an active session.Specifically, manual static analysis is useful for evaluating the correctness of allocation calculations. This can be useful for detecting overflow conditions (CWE-190) or similar weaknesses that might have serious security impacts on the program.Effectiveness: HighNote:These may be more effective than strictly automated techniques. This is especially the case with weaknesses that are related to design and business rules.Automated Static Analysis - Binary or BytecodeAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Highly cost effective:Bytecode Weakness Analysis - including disassembler + source code weakness analysisBinary Weakness Analysis - including disassembler + source code weakness analysisEffectiveness: HighManual Static Analysis - Binary or BytecodeAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Cost effective for partial coverage:Binary / Bytecode disassembler - then use manual analysis for vulnerabilities & anomaliesEffectiveness: SOAR PartialManual Static Analysis - Source CodeAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Cost effective for partial coverage:Focused Manual Spotcheck - Focused manual analysis of sourceManual Source Code Review (not inspections)Effectiveness: SOAR PartialAutomated Static Analysis - Source CodeAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Highly cost effective:Source code Weakness AnalyzerContext-configured Source Code Weakness AnalyzerCost effective for partial coverage:Source Code Quality AnalyzerEffectiveness: HighArchitecture or Design ReviewAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Highly cost effective:Formal Methods / Correct-By-ConstructionCost effective for partial coverage:Inspection (IEEE 1028 standard) (can apply to requirements, design, source code, etc.)Effectiveness: High\",\n    \"Functional Areas\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Affected Resources\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Memberships\": \"NatureTypeIDNameMemberOf742CERT C Secure Coding Standard (2008) Chapter 9 - Memory Management (MEM)MemberOf8022010 Top 25 - Risky Resource ManagementMemberOf8652011 Top 25 - Risky Resource ManagementMemberOf876CERT C++ Secure Coding Section 08 - Memory Management (MEM)MemberOf884CWE Cross-sectionMemberOf974SFP Secondary Cluster: Incorrect Buffer Length ComputationMemberOf1158SEI CERT C Coding Standard - Guidelines 04.

This could allow an attacker to upload any executable file or other file with malicious code.Additionally, the creation of the BufferedWriter object is subject to relative path traversal (CWE-23). Since the code does not check the filename that is provided in the header, an attacker can use \\\"../\\\" sequences to write to files outside of the intended directory. Depending on the executing environment, the attacker may be able to specify arbitrary files to write to, leading to a wide variety of consequences, from code execution, XSS (CWE-79), or system crash.Example 2This code includes an external script to get database credentials, then authenticates a user against the database, allowing access to the application.(bad code)Example Language:PHP//assume the password is already encrypted, avoidingCWE-312function authenticate($username,$password){include(\\\"http://external.example.com/dbInfo.php\\\");//dbInfo.php makes $dbhost, $dbuser, $dbpass, $dbname availablemysql_connect($dbhost, $dbuser, $dbpass) or die ('Error connecting to mysql');mysql_select_db($dbname);$query = 'Select * from users where username='.$username.' And password='.$password;$result = mysql_query($query);if(mysql_numrows($result) == 1){mysql_close();return true;}else{mysql_close();return false;}}This code does not verify that the external domain accessed is the intended one. An attacker may somehow cause the external domain name to resolve to an attack server, which would provide the information for a false database. The attacker may then steal the usernames and encrypted passwords from real user login attempts, or simply allow themself to access the application without a real user account.This example is also vulnerable to an Adversary-in-the-Middle AITM (CWE-300) attack.Example 3This code either generates a public HTML user information page or a JSON response containing the same user information.(bad code)Example Language:PHP// API flag, output JSON if set$json = $_GET['json']$username = $_GET['user']if(!$json){$record = getUserRecord($username);foreach($record as $fieldName => $fieldValue){if($fieldName == \\\"email_address\\\") {// skip displaying user emailscontinue;}else{writeToHtmlPage($fieldName,$fieldValue);}}}else{$record = getUserRecord($username);echo json_encode($record);}The programmer is careful to not display the user's e-mail address when displaying the public HTML page.

Use an appropriate combination of denylists and allowlists to ensure only valid, expected and appropriate input is processed by the system.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Input ValidationAssume all input is malicious. Use an \\\"accept known good\\\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \\\"boat\\\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \\\"red\\\" or \\\"blue.\\\"Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Output EncodingWhile it is risky to use dynamically-generated query strings, code, or commands that mix control and data together, sometimes it may be unavoidable. Properly quote arguments and escape any special characters within those arguments. The most conservative approach is to escape or filter all characters that do not pass an extremely strict allowlist (such as everything that is not alphanumeric or white space). If some special characters are still needed, such as white space, wrap each argument in quotes after the escaping/filtering step. Be careful of argument injection (CWE-88).\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Input ValidationInputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180). Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice (CWE-174).

If the attacker provides a large enough value, the application will run into an OutOfMemoryError.Example 3This code performs a stack allocation based on a length calculation.(bad code)Example Language:Cint a = 5, b = 6;size_t len = a - b;char buf[len];    // Just blows up the stack}Since a and b are declared as signed ints, the \\\"a - b\\\" subtraction gives a negative result (-1). However, since len is declared to be unsigned, len is cast to an extremely large positive number (on 32-bit systems - 4294967295). As a result, the buffer buf[len] declaration uses an extremely large size to allocate on the stack, very likely more than the entire computer's memory space.Miscalculations usually will not be so obvious. The calculation will either be complicated or the result of an attacker's input to attain the negative value.Example 4This example shows a typical attempt to parse a string with an error resulting from a difference in assumptions between the caller to a function and the function's action.(bad code)Example Language:Cint proc_msg(char *s, int msg_len){// Note space at the end of the string - assume all strings have preamble with spaceint pre_len = sizeof(\\\"preamble: \\\");char buf[pre_len - msg_len];... Do processing here if we get this far}char *s = \\\"preamble: message\\\\n\\\";char *sl = strchr(s, ':');        // Number of characters up to ':' (not including space)int jnklen = sl == NULL ? 0 : sl - s;    // If undefined pointer, use zero lengthint ret_val = proc_msg (\\\"s\\\",  jnklen);    // Violate assumption of preamble length, end up with negative value, blow out stackThe buffer length ends up being -1, resulting in a blown out stack. The space character after the colon is included in the function calculation, but not in the caller's calculation. This, unfortunately, is not usually so obvious but exists in an obtuse series of calculations.Example 5The following code obtains an untrusted number that is used as an index into an array of messages.(bad code)Example Language:Perlmy $num = GetUntrustedNumber();my @messages = ();$messages[$num] = \\\"Hello World\\\";The index is not validated at all (CWE-129), so it might be possible for an attacker to modify an element in @messages that was not intended. If an index is used that is larger than the current size of the array, the Perl interpreter automatically expands the array so that the large index works.If $num is a large value such as 2147483648 (1<<31), then the assignment to $messages[$num] would attempt to create a very large array, then eventually produce an error message such as:Out of memory during array extendThis memory exhaustion will cause the Perl program to exit, possibly a denial of service. In addition, the lack of memory could also prevent many other programs from successfully running on the system.Example 6This example shows a typical attempt to parse a string with an error resulting from a difference in assumptions between the caller to a function and the function's action. The buffer length ends up being -1 resulting in a blown out stack. The space character after the colon is included  in the function calculation, but not in the caller's calculation.

Die evil hacker!\\\\n\\\");}/* proceed assuming n and m are initialized correctly */}This code attempts to extract two integer values out of a formatted, user-supplied input. However, if an attacker were to provide an input of the form:(attack code)123:then only the m variable will be initialized. Subsequent use of n may result in the use of an uninitialized variable (CWE-457).Example 2Here, an uninitialized field in a Java class is used in a seldom-called method, which would cause a NullPointerException to be thrown.(bad code)Example Language:Javaprivate User user;public void someMethod() {// Do something interesting....// Throws NPE if user hasn't been properly initialized.String username = user.getName();}Example 3This code first authenticates a user, then allows a delete command if the user is an administrator.(bad code)Example Language:PHPif (authenticate($username,$password) && setAdmin($username)){$isAdmin = true;}/.../if ($isAdmin){deleteUser($userToDelete);}The $isAdmin variable is set to true if the user is an admin, but is uninitialized otherwise. If PHP's register_globals feature is enabled, an attacker can set uninitialized variables like $isAdmin to arbitrary values, in this case gaining administrator privileges by setting $isAdmin to true.Example 4In the following Java code the BankManager class uses the user variable of the class User to allow authorized users to perform bank manager tasks. The user variable is initialized within the method setUser that retrieves the User from the User database. The user is then authenticated as unauthorized user through the method authenticateUser.(bad code)Example Language:Javapublic class BankManager {// user allowed to perform bank manager tasksprivate User user = null;private boolean isUserAuthentic = false;// constructor for BankManager classpublic BankManager() {...}// retrieve user from database of userspublic User getUserFromUserDatabase(String username){...}// set user variable using usernamepublic void setUser(String username) {this.user = getUserFromUserDatabase(username);}// authenticate userpublic boolean authenticateUser(String username, String password) {if (username.equals(user.getUsername()) && password.equals(user.getPassword())) {isUserAuthentic = true;}return isUserAuthentic;}// methods for performing bank manager tasks...}However, if the method setUser is not called before authenticateUser then the user variable will not have been initialized and will result in a NullPointerException. The code should verify that the user variable has been initialized before it is used, as in the following code.(good code)Example Language:Javapublic class BankManager {// user allowed to perform bank manager tasksprivate User user = null;private boolean isUserAuthentic = false;// constructor for BankManager classpublic BankManager(String username) {user = getUserFromUserDatabase(username);}// retrieve user from database of userspublic User getUserFromUserDatabase(String username) {...}// authenticate userpublic boolean authenticateUser(String username, String password) {if (user == null) {System.out.println(\\\"Cannot find user \\\" + username);}else {if (password.equals(user.getPassword())) {isUserAuthentic = true;}}return isUserAuthentic;}// methods for performing bank manager tasks...}Example 5This example will leave test_string in an unknown condition when i is the same value as err_val, because test_string is not initialized (CWE-456). Depending on where this code segment appears (e.g. within a function body), test_string might be random if it is stored on the heap or stack. If the variable is declared in static memory, it might be zero or NULL. Compiler optimization might contribute to the unpredictability of this address.(bad code)Example Language:Cchar *test_string;if (i != err_val){test_string = \\\"Hello World!\\\";}printf(\\\"%s\\\", test_string);When the printf() is reached, test_string might be an unexpected address, so the printf might print junk strings (CWE-457).To fix this code, there are a couple approaches to\\n\\t\\t\\t  making sure that test_string has been properly set once\\n\\t\\t\\t  it reaches the printf().One solution would be to set test_string to an\\n\\t\\t\\t  acceptable default before the conditional:(good code)Example Language:Cchar *test_string = \\\"Done at the beginning\\\";if (i != err_val){test_string = \\\"Hello World!\\\";}printf(\\\"%s\\\", test_string);Another solution is to ensure that each\\n\\t\\t\\t  branch of the conditional - including the default/else\\n\\t\\t\\t  branch - could ensure that test_string is set:(good code)Example Language:Cchar *test_string;if (i != err_val){test_string = \\\"Hello World!\\\";}else {test_string = \\\"Done on the other side!\\\";}printf(\\\"%s\\\", test_string);\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2020-6078Chain: The return value of a function returning a pointer is not checked for success (CWE-252) resulting in the later use of an uninitialized variable (CWE-456) and a null pointer dereference (CWE-476)CVE-2009-2692Chain: Use of an unimplemented network socket operation pointing to an uninitialized handler function (CWE-456) causes a crash because of a null pointer dereference (CWE-476).CVE-2020-20739A variable that has its value set in a conditional statement is sometimes used when the conditional fails, sometimes causing data leakageCVE-2005-2978Product uses uninitialized variables for size and index, leading to resultant buffer overflow.CVE-2005-2109Internal variable in PHP application is not initialized, allowing external modification.CVE-2005-2193Array variable not initialized in PHP application, leading to resultant SQL injection.\",\n    \"References\": \"[REF-62] Mark Dowd, John McDonald\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand Justin Schuh. \\\"The Art of Software Security Assessment\\\".

If the user enters \\\"Very_very_long_last_name\\\" which is 24 characters long, then a buffer overflow will occur since the array can only hold 20 characters total.Example 2The following code attempts to create a local copy of a buffer to perform some manipulations to the data.(bad code)Example Language:Cvoid manipulate_string(char * string){char buf[24];strcpy(buf, string);...}However, the programmer does not ensure that the size of the data pointed to by string will fit in the local buffer and copies the data with the potentially dangerous strcpy() function. This may result in a buffer overflow condition if an attacker can influence the contents of the string parameter.Example 3The code below calls the gets() function to read in data from the command line.(bad code)Example Language:Cchar buf[24];printf(\\\"Please enter your name and press <Enter>\\\\n\\\");gets(buf);...}However, gets() is inherently unsafe, because it copies all input from STDIN to the buffer without checking size. This allows the user to provide a string that is larger than the buffer size, resulting in an overflow condition.Example 4In the following example, a server accepts connections from a client and processes the client request.

Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer.Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignStrategy:  Libraries or FrameworksUse a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.Note:This is not a complete solution, since many buffer overflows are not related to strings.\\n\\nPhases:  Operation; Build and CompilationStrategy:  Environment HardeningUse automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking.D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail.Effectiveness: Defense in DepthNote:This is not necessarily a complete solution, since these mechanisms only detect certain types of overflows. In addition, the result is still a denial of service, since the typical response is to exit the application.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationConsider adhering to the following rules when allocating and managing an application's memory:Double check that your buffer is as large as you specify.When using functions that accept a number of bytes to copy, such as strncpy(), be aware that if the destination buffer size is equal to the source buffer size, it may not NULL-terminate the string.Check buffer boundaries if accessing the buffer in a loop and make sure there is no danger of writing past the allocated space.If necessary, truncate all input strings to a reasonable length before passing them to the copy and concatenation functions.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationStrategy:  Input ValidationAssume all input is malicious. Use an \\\"accept known good\\\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \\\"boat\\\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \\\"red\\\" or \\\"blue.\\\"Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignFor any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoidCWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.\\n\\nPhases:  Operation; Build and CompilationStrategy:  Environment HardeningRun or compile the software using features or extensions that randomly arrange the positions of a program's executable and libraries in memory. Because this makes the addresses unpredictable, it can prevent an attacker from reliably jumping to exploitable code.Examples include Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) [REF-58] [REF-60] and Position-Independent Executables (PIE) [REF-64]. Imported modules may be similarly realigned if their default memory addresses conflict with other modules, in a process known as \\\"rebasing\\\" (for Windows) and \\\"prelinking\\\" (for Linux) [REF-1332] using randomly generated addresses. ASLR for libraries cannot be used in conjunction with prelink since it would require relocating the libraries at run-time, defeating the whole purpose of prelinking.For more information on these techniques see D3-SAOR (Segment Address Offset Randomization) from D3FEND [REF-1335].Effectiveness: Defense in DepthNote:These techniques do not provide a complete solution. For instance, exploits frequently use a bug that discloses memory addresses in order to maximize reliability of code execution [REF-1337]. It has also been shown that a side-channel attack can bypass ASLR [REF-1333]\\n\\nPhase:  OperationStrategy:  Environment HardeningUse a CPU and operating system that offers Data Execution Protection (using hardware NX or XD bits) or the equivalent techniques that simulate this feature in software, such as PaX [REF-60] [REF-61]. These techniques ensure that any instruction executed is exclusively at a memory address that is part of the code segment.For more information on these techniques see D3-PSEP (Process Segment Execution Prevention) from D3FEND [REF-1336].Effectiveness: Defense in DepthNote:This is not a complete solution, since buffer overflows could be used to overwrite nearby variables to modify the software's state in dangerous ways. In addition, it cannot be used in cases in which self-modifying code is required. Finally, an attack could still cause a denial of service, since the typical response is to exit the application.\\n\\nPhases:  Build and Compilation; OperationMost mitigating technologies at the compiler or OS level to date address only a subset of buffer overflow problems and rarely provide complete protection against even that subset. It is good practice to implement strategies to increase the workload of an attacker, such as leaving the attacker to guess an unknown value that changes every program execution.\\n\\nPhase:  ImplementationReplace unbounded copy functions with analogous functions that support length arguments, such as strcpy with strncpy. Create these if they are not available.Effectiveness: ModerateNote:This approach is still susceptible to calculation errors, including issues such as off-by-one errors (CWE-193) and incorrectly calculating buffer lengths (CWE-131).\\n\\nPhase:  Architecture and DesignStrategy:  Enforcement by ConversionWhen the set of acceptable objects, such as filenames or URLs, is limited or known, create a mapping from a set of fixed input values (such as numeric IDs) to the actual filenames or URLs, and reject all other inputs.\\n\\nPhases:  Architecture and Design; OperationStrategy:  Environment HardeningRun your code using the lowest privileges that are required to accomplish the necessary tasks [REF-76]. If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a single task. That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.\\n\\nPhases:  Architecture and Design; OperationStrategy:  Sandbox or JailRun the code in a \\\"jail\\\" or similar sandbox environment that enforces strict boundaries between the process and the operating system. This may effectively restrict which files can be accessed in a particular directory or which commands can be executed by the software.OS-level examples include the Unix chroot jail, AppArmor, and SELinux. In general, managed code may provide some protection. For example, java.io.FilePermission in the Java SecurityManager allows the software to specify restrictions on file operations.This may not be a feasible solution, and it only limits the impact to the operating system; the rest of the application may still be subject to compromise.Be careful to avoidCWE-243and other weaknesses related to jails.Effectiveness: LimitedNote:The effectiveness of this mitigation depends on the prevention capabilities of the specific sandbox or jail being used and might only help to reduce the scope of an attack, such as restricting the attacker to certain system calls or limiting the portion of the file system that can be accessed.\",\n    \"Weakness Ordinalities\": \"OrdinalityDescriptionResultant(where the weakness is typically related to the presence of some other weaknesses)Primary(where the weakness exists independent of other weaknesses)\",\n    \"Detection Methods\": \"Automated Static AnalysisThis weakness can often be detected using automated static analysis tools. Many modern tools use data flow analysis or constraint-based techniques to minimize the number of false positives.Automated static analysis generally does not account for environmental considerations when reporting out-of-bounds memory operations. This can make it difficult for users to determine which warnings should be investigated first. For example, an analysis tool might report buffer overflows that originate from command line arguments in a program that is not expected to run with setuid or other special privileges.Effectiveness: HighNote:Detection techniques for buffer-related errors are more mature than for most other weakness types.Automated Dynamic AnalysisThis weakness can be detected using dynamic tools and techniques that interact with the software using large test suites with many diverse inputs, such as fuzz testing (fuzzing), robustness testing, and fault injection. The software's operation may slow down, but it should not become unstable, crash, or generate incorrect results.Manual AnalysisManual analysis can be useful for finding this weakness, but it might not achieve desired code coverage within limited time constraints.

It takes the total amount of the transfer, sends it to the new account, and deducts the amount from the original account.(bad code)Example Language:Perl$transfer_amount = GetTransferAmount();$balance = GetBalanceFromDatabase();if ($transfer_amount < 0) {FatalError(\\\"Bad Transfer Amount\\\");}$newbalance = $balance - $transfer_amount;if (($balance - $transfer_amount) < 0) {FatalError(\\\"Insufficient Funds\\\");}SendNewBalanceToDatabase($newbalance);NotifyUser(\\\"Transfer of $transfer_amount succeeded.\\\");NotifyUser(\\\"New balance: $newbalance\\\");A race condition could occur between the calls to GetBalanceFromDatabase() and SendNewBalanceToDatabase().Suppose the balance is initially 100.00. An attack could be constructed as follows:(attack code)Example Language:OtherIn the following pseudocode, the attacker makes two simultaneous calls of the program, CALLER-1 and CALLER-2. Both callers are for the same user account.CALLER-1 (the attacker) is associated with PROGRAM-1 (the instance that handles CALLER-1). CALLER-2 is associated with PROGRAM-2.CALLER-1 makes a transfer request of 80.00.PROGRAM-1 calls GetBalanceFromDatabase and sets $balance to 100.00PROGRAM-1 calculates $newbalance as 20.00, then calls SendNewBalanceToDatabase().Due to high server load, the PROGRAM-1 call to SendNewBalanceToDatabase() encounters a delay.CALLER-2 makes a transfer request of 1.00.PROGRAM-2 calls GetBalanceFromDatabase() and sets $balance to 100.00. This happens because the previous PROGRAM-1 request was not processed yet.PROGRAM-2 determines the new balance as 99.00.After the initial delay, PROGRAM-1 commits its balance to the database, setting it to 20.00.PROGRAM-2 sends a request to update the database, setting the balance to 99.00At this stage, the attacker should have a balance of 19.00 (due to 81.00 worth of transfers), but the balance is 99.00, as recorded in the database.To prevent this weakness, the programmer has several options, including using a lock to prevent multiple simultaneous requests to the web application, or using a synchronization mechanism that includes all the code between GetBalanceFromDatabase() and SendNewBalanceToDatabase().Example 2The following function attempts to acquire a lock in order to perform operations on a shared resource.(bad code)Example Language:Cvoid f(pthread_mutex_t *mutex) {pthread_mutex_lock(mutex);/* access shared resource */pthread_mutex_unlock(mutex);}However, the code does not check the value returned by pthread_mutex_lock() for errors. If pthread_mutex_lock() cannot acquire the mutex for any reason, the function may introduce a race condition into the program and result in undefined behavior.In order to avoid data races, correctly written programs must check the result of thread synchronization functions and appropriately handle all errors, either by attempting to recover from them or reporting them to higher levels.(good code)Example Language:Cint f(pthread_mutex_t *mutex) {int result;result = pthread_mutex_lock(mutex);if (0 != result)return result;/* access shared resource */return pthread_mutex_unlock(mutex);}Example 3Suppose a processor's Memory Management Unit (MMU) has 5 other shadow MMUs to distribute its workload for its various cores. Each MMU has the start address and end address of \\\"accessible\\\" memory. Any time this accessible range changes (as per the processor's boot status), the main MMU sends an update message to all the shadow MMUs.Suppose the interconnect fabric does not prioritize such \\\"update\\\" packets over other general traffic packets. This introduces a race condition. If an attacker can flood the target with enough messages so that some of those attack packets reach the target before the new access ranges gets updated, then the attacker can leverage this scenario.\",\n    \"Observed Examples\": \"ReferenceDescriptionCVE-2022-29527Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.CVE-2021-1782Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.CVE-2021-0920Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.CVE-2020-6819Chain: race condition (CWE-362) leads to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.CVE-2019-18827chain: JTAG interface is not disabled (CWE-1191) during ROM code execution, introducing a race condition (CWE-362) to extract encryption keysCVE-2019-1161Chain: race condition (CWE-362) in anti-malware product allows deletion of files by creating a junction (CWE-1386) and using hard links during the time window in which a temporary file is created and deleted.CVE-2015-1743TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executedCVE-2014-8273Chain: chipset has a race condition (CWE-362) between when an interrupt handler detects an attempt to write-enable the BIOS (in violation of the lock bit), and when the handler resets the write-enable bit back to 0, allowing attackers to issue BIOS writes during the timing window [REF-1237].CVE-2008-5044Race condition leading to a crash by calling a hook removal procedure while other activities are occurring at the same time.CVE-2008-2958chain: time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in program allows bypass of protection mechanism that was designed to prevent symlink attacks.CVE-2008-1570chain: time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in program allows bypass of protection mechanism that was designed to prevent symlink attacks.CVE-2008-0058Unsynchronized caching operation enables a race condition that causes messages to be sent to a deallocated object.CVE-2008-0379Race condition during initialization triggers a buffer overflow.CVE-2007-6599Daemon crash by quickly performing operations and undoing them, which eventually leads to an operation that does not acquire a lock.CVE-2007-6180chain: race condition triggers NULL pointer dereferenceCVE-2007-5794Race condition in library function could cause data to be sent to the wrong process.CVE-2007-3970Race condition in file parser leads to heap corruption.CVE-2008-5021chain: race condition allows attacker to access an object while it is still being initialized, causing software to access uninitialized memory.CVE-2009-4895chain: race condition for an argument value, possibly resulting in NULL dereferenceCVE-2009-3547chain: race condition might allow resource to be released before operating on it, leading to NULL dereferenceCVE-2006-5051Chain: Signal handler contains too much functionality (CWE-828), introducing a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a double free (CWE-415).\",\n    \"References\": \"[REF-44] Michael Howard, David LeBlanc\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand John Viega. \\\"24 Deadly Sins of Software Security\\\". \\\"Sin 13: Race Conditions.\\\" Page 205.

The software's operation may slow down, but it should not become unstable, crash, or generate incorrect results.Race conditions may be detected with a stress-test by calling the software simultaneously from a large number of threads or processes, and look for evidence of any unexpected behavior.Insert breakpoints or delays in between relevant code statements to artificially expand the race window so that it will be easier to detect.Effectiveness: ModerateAutomated Static Analysis - Binary or BytecodeAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Highly cost effective:Bytecode Weakness Analysis - including disassembler + source code weakness analysisCost effective for partial coverage:Binary Weakness Analysis - including disassembler + source code weakness analysisEffectiveness: HighDynamic Analysis with Automated Results InterpretationAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Cost effective for partial coverage:Web Application ScannerWeb Services ScannerDatabase ScannersEffectiveness: SOAR PartialDynamic Analysis with Manual Results InterpretationAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Highly cost effective:Framework-based FuzzerCost effective for partial coverage:Fuzz TesterMonitored Virtual Environment - run potentially malicious code in sandbox / wrapper / virtual machine, see if it does anything suspiciousEffectiveness: HighManual Static Analysis - Source CodeAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Highly cost effective:Manual Source Code Review (not inspections)Cost effective for partial coverage:Focused Manual Spotcheck - Focused manual analysis of sourceEffectiveness: HighAutomated Static Analysis - Source CodeAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Highly cost effective:Source code Weakness AnalyzerContext-configured Source Code Weakness AnalyzerEffectiveness: HighArchitecture or Design ReviewAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:Highly cost effective:Formal Methods / Correct-By-ConstructionCost effective for partial coverage:Inspection (IEEE 1028 standard) (can apply to requirements, design, source code, etc.)Effectiveness: High\",\n    \"Functional Areas\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Affected Resources\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Memberships\": \"NatureTypeIDNameMemberOf635Weaknesses Originally Used by NVD from 2008 to 2016MemberOf743CERT C Secure Coding Standard (2008) Chapter 10 - Input Output (FIO)MemberOf7512009 Top 25 - Insecure Interaction Between ComponentsMemberOf8012010 Top 25 - Insecure Interaction Between ComponentsMemberOf852The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011) Chapter 9 - Visibility and Atomicity (VNA)MemberOf8672011 Top 25 - Weaknesses On the CuspMemberOf877CERT C++ Secure Coding Section 09 - Input Output (FIO)MemberOf882CERT C++ Secure Coding Section 14 - Concurrency (CON)MemberOf988SFP Secondary Cluster: Race Condition WindowMemberOf1003Weaknesses for Simplified Mapping of Published VulnerabilitiesMemberOf1142SEI CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java - Guidelines 08.
